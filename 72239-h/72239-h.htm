  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Following every widespread epidemic or pandemic of influenza,
the contemporary literature becomes virtually flooded with reports of
scientific studies on the etiology and the epidemiology of the disease.
By the time that recrudescences have ceased, interest has usually
lagged and eventually research in this subject has practically ceased,
only to be revived with the development of the next extensive epidemic.</p>

<p class='c007'>To one who has had occasion to review the extensive literature of
the last pandemic, it becomes apparent that many of the recent writers
are uninformed, or at best only partially informed, regarding the rather
extensive information accumulated during the 1889 epidemic. The
longer one studies the observations made in 1889–93 the more firmly
convinced one becomes that the recent pandemic was identical with
the former in practically all of its manifestations.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is desirable that, following each epidemic prevalence some individual
or individuals review the literature of the preceding epidemics,
acquaint himself with what has been written regarding influenza in
the intervening time up to the epidemic prevalence and correlate the
work done in these two periods with the various reports regarding the
latest epidemic.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following pages constitute an attempt to correlate the epidemiologic
observations of the epidemic thirty years ago with those of
the 1918–20 epidemic, and with the observations made during the
intervening years.</p>

<p class='c007'>The house census in the City of Boston and the preparation of
this monograph were made possible by the financial assistance of the
Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. This organization has devoted
a considerable sum of money to the study of influenza in its
various phases.</p>

<p class='c007'>The author is indebted to his chief, Dr. Milton J. Rosenau, for
helpful advice and criticism and for the inspiration to carry on this
investigation. Dr. W. H. Frost has made many valuable suggestions.
Appreciation is also due Mr. Edwin M. Knights, who is responsible
for all of the charts, and to Mrs. V. K. Davis, who aided in the tabulation
of results of the Boston investigation.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>The house-to-house census was carried out with the co-operation
and assistance of the Federated Jewish Charities in Boston and individual
members of the social service departments of the Massachusetts
General Hospital and the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><i>General Epidemiologic Considerations.</i></h3>

<p class='c013'>Those who seek to find in a study of the epidemiology of epidemic
influenza the secret of the causation of the disease, and its ultimate
eradication, are probably predestined to at least partial failure. We
must call upon the bacteriologist for information as to the causative
organism, and in time he may be able to furnish us with satisfactory
prophylactic measures, particularly with a successful vaccine.</p>

<p class='c007'>But while pure epidemiologic studies will not demonstrate the
ultimate factor in the etiology, nevertheless these studies do subserve
several most important functions. The bacteriologist, the immunologist,
the serologist have accumulated a wealth of information since
the 1918 pandemic, but as far as definite conclusions concerning the
causative agent of the disease are concerned we are no nearer to the
truth than we were at the time when Pfeiffer made his original observations.
There is no incontrovertible evidence by which one may
say that the influenza bacillus is or is not the cause of the disease. We
must therefore await further studies and future discoveries. But
we cannot await idly in the knowledge that new epidemics of the
dread disease will surely come, probably mild ones in the next few
years, and certainly severe ones again within a few decades. We
must amass all of the available information concerning the mode of
action of the disease, its manner of spread, its degree of infectivity, its
distribution and the mode of its recurrences, and try to formulate
from a study of the available facts some means of protecting ourselves
against the epidemic, if not of preventing it entirely.</p>

<p class='c007'>In short, in the present state of the bacteriologic knowledge of the
disease, we may say that the epidemiologic features are the only facts
upon which we have to build in planning our defense. Today, the
practical work in the eradication of influenza must depend chiefly, if
not solely, on the general methods of preventive medicine.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Many valuable monographs have been written on the subject,
particularly following the pandemic of 1889–1893, but these have all
emphasized features and phases of the disease which seemed at that
time to be particularly important. Facts which seemed of extreme
importance to the earlier writers are today in some instances considered
relatively unimportant, while other phenomena which were but
touched upon by the former investigators today have assumed deep
significance. For this reason it is worth while to reproduce here the
observations made in previous epidemics, and to correlate them with
the facts developed in the abundant literature of the last few years,
and to draw therefrom inferences as to the life and habits of the influenza
virus, and conclusions as to the means of interrupting its
progress.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Historical.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>The history of influenza can justly be divided into two phases, the
first ancient, and the second modern. The latter period begins
with the 1889 pandemic. By that time the science of bacteriology
had altered our concepts of the etiology of disease and epidemiologists
had begun to avail themselves of statistical methods of analysis.
For the purposes of this paper, therefore, consideration will be given
chiefly to the epidemic of 1889, and a summary of earlier epidemics
will be made merely to refresh our minds concerning the antiquity of
the disease and the periods of its occurrence. References to the
earlier epidemics will be made more particularly in the special discussions
later, where points of similarity or difference will be brought out.
Further than that it is unnecessary to go in the history of the disease,
for the several excellent monographs of 1890 to 1900 tell the historical
story in a manner that could scarcely be improved upon.</p>

<p class='c007'>The great antiquity of epidemic influenza is a fact which I think
may be admitted in spite of some who hesitate to accept it because of
lack of convincing descriptive evidence. Some believe that the
epidemic of the year 412 B.C., described by Hippocrates and by Livy,
was an epidemic of influenza. Some have suggested that the epidemic
described by Thucydides was the same disease. Parkes remarks
that the epidemic pervading the Athenian Army in Sicily in 415 B.C.,
recorded by Diodorus Siculus, has been supposed to have been influenza.
Finkler, in referring to a report by Diodorus of a pestilence
occurring in 395 B.C., which broke out in the Greek Army at the siege
of Syracuse, and which killed off the soldiers murderously, says that
this could not have been influenza. He regards as sufficient argument
the fact that the mortality was high. After the epidemic of 1918, one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>is more inclined to believe that the epidemic in Sicily may well have
been true influenza. We must remember that previous to the last
few pandemics the stories have been fragmentary in character and
were told, not by physicians, but chiefly by the historians of the time,
men who have desired to impress their readers with some idea of the
horrible ravages of the disease, and who have doubtless in some instances
transmitted the impression of monstrous mortality rates. The
early historians were much given to figures of speech, many of which
were very telling in conveying the impression desired. Finally, the
writers of the middle ages and of earlier times had little or no statistical
material on which to base their conclusions. I have no doubt that
a historian who during the 1918 epidemic of influenza might have
limited his observations entirely to the disease as it occurred at Camp
Sherman, Ohio, and who saw 125 robust soldiers dying each day,
would have truly written that the disease killed off the soldiers murderously.
A further statistical argument in favor of considering the
epidemic among the Greek soldiers as quite possibly influenza is the
fact that as shown by present day findings these men were all of the
age in which the mortality is highest, and were living under sanitary
conditions which predispose to high incidence and high mortality.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Parkes, in 827 A.D., an attack of “cough” which
spread like the plague was recorded. In 876, Italy and later the whole
of Europe was attacked, and the army of Charlemagne, returning
from Italy, suffered greatly. “Dogs and birds were attacked at this
time.” In 976 the whole of France and Germany was attacked by a
fever whose principal symptom was cough. There is also record of
diseases which may have been influenza which were seen in Germany
and France in 927 and in England in 996 and 997. All of these records
are indefinite and from their nature unconvincing to a critical student.
Several investigators have gone over these past records up to 1889
with the idea of determining definitely what plagues were, and which
were not, true influenza. The criteria used by the various investigators
have differed slightly in some instances. For instance, one
chooses to use the record of low mortality in widespread epidemics as
the chief characteristic of pandemic influenza, while another emphasizes
principally the complications.</p>

<p class='c007'>The experience of recent years has amply demonstrated that
influenza may be characterized by a high mortality or a low mortality;
that pneumonia may be prevalent or relatively rare during an epidemic.
These features are not truly characteristic of influenza itself.
They are phenomena which depend chiefly for their existence on
secondary invasion with organisms other than the causative agent of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>influenza. It may be that the influenza virus itself is capable of
producing pneumonia, but it is generally accepted that an overwhelming
majority of the complicating pneumonias are due to secondary
infections. One perusing the former literature today would hesitate
to state that an ancient epidemic was not influenza merely because
it was accompanied by high mortality, nor would he wish to say that
it was not this disease because there was no mention of a high incidence
of pneumonia. We have had both types within the last few years,
as in March and April, 1918, when the disease appears to have been
accompanied by a very low mortality and a low incidence of pneumonia,
and in October of the same year when the pneumonia incidence
and the death rate were both relatively much higher.</p>

<p class='c007'>Attention should be called to a certain inaccuracy which has
appeared in the literature and which has resulted in some instances in
a misunderstanding of the entire history of influenza. Finkler says:
“According to August Hirsch the first influenza epidemic occurred in
1173 and he places it in his work as the first out of eighty.” This
has given the impression to some that influenza was unknown previous
to that date. Leichtenstern has quoted Hirsch more accurately and
thereby given an entirely different meaning to the statement. “August
Hirsch says that the first epidemic that can be definitely said to
be influenza occurred in 1173.” Jordan also conveys the latter
impression. He remarks that the first extensive, well described
epidemic of influenza occurred in 1510.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hirsch places the first authoritative influenza epidemic in the year
1173; Zeviani in 1293; Gluge in 1323; Schweich, Biermer and Ripperger
in 1387; while Saillant, Thompson, Zuelzer and Leichtenstern
accept nothing prior to the first pandemic of 1510 as being unquestionably
influenza. It should be remarked here that opinion is not unanimous
in every case as to the identity of all epidemics following 1510.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hirsch concluded that there have been about eighty epidemics
since that of 1173. Parkes states that in the fourteenth century there
were six epidemics, in the fifteenth seven, in the sixteenth eleven, in
the seventeenth sixteen, in the eighteenth eighteen, while in the first
half of the nineteenth ten epidemics are on record.</p>

<p class='c007'>Table I shows in brief review the occurrence of the more important
epidemics since the year 1173. Like all similar summaries given in
tabular form it possesses the disadvantage of telling only parts of the
entire story, and those in only a very general way, but it will suffice
as a resumé and for the emphasis of certain phenomena to which attention
will be later directed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Concerning the epidemic of 1889, it is usually stated that it had its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>origin in Bokhara in May of that year. As will be seen from the table
influenza was present also in Greenland and the Hudson Bay territory
in the spring of 1889. The possibility of simultaneous origin in at
least two localities in that year will be discussed later. The epidemic
remained in Bokhara until August of the same year, after which time
it slowly traveled to Siberia where at Tomsk traces of the disease
were observed with certainty in October. At that time it was also
observed in the Caucasus and in European Russia. It appeared in
Petrograd in October, 1889, and remained epidemic until December
of that year. The spread of this epidemic throughout the world is
indicated in the following table adopted from Leichtenstern:</p>

<p class='c007'>Between the years 1889 and 1893 according to Leichtenstern there
was no period altogether free from influenza. Here and there individual
cases or small epidemics sharply localized were observed. In
1893 another epidemic appeared in many places and became quite
widespread. There was not, according to this author, the definite
geographic progression that had been observed in 1889. This was
but a recrudescence, a lighting up from endemic foci remaining after
the first wide spread. In the first half of 1893 there was a light spring
epidemic, and in November of the same year a larger epidemic swept
over the whole of Europe. The height of the latter was reached
chiefly in December.</p>

<p class='c007'>The influenza incidence subsequent to 1893 will be discussed later.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Table I shows that prior to 1510 the information was so limited as
to be not entirely conclusive. We must rely upon the fragmentary
descriptions of writers located usually in or near the intellectual centers
who described the disease as they saw it in their city or country. We
have no way of ascertaining what other countries were invaded, and
we possess no method by which we may enumerate the “silent areas,”
countries which in the absence of a chronicler have not been able to
transmit their story.</p>

<p class='c007'>There have been fourteen very widespread epidemics since 1510,
all of which might appropriately be designated as pandemics. They
are those of 1510, 1557, 1580, 1593, 1729, 1732, 1762, 1782, 1788, 1830,
1833, 1836, 1847, 1889 and 1918. Some of these have spread farther
than others according to the records, but in nearly all we have reports
of influenza being present in practically every country provided with
a historian. We may find from the table another group in which
there have been more or less extensive epidemics, apparently related,
but without any general direction of spread. Such are the epidemics
of 1709–12, 1757–67, 1802–03, 1838–47 and the period 1850–59.
Finally, there are at least ten periods during which relatively small
areas have been affected with epidemic influenza. Such for instance
is the year 1688 when the disease was apparently localized in Great
Britain and Ireland; in the year 1693 when England and the adjacent
continent were involved, with little spread elsewhere; and again in
1742, when there was a slow spread through Germany into adjacent
countries with recurrences in the former up until 1745.</p>

<p class='c007'>In England the following epidemics have been recorded, some of
them in great detail: 1510 and 1557, described by Thomas Short;
1658 by Willis; 1675, by Sydenham; 1729–1743 by Huxham; 1732–33
by Arbuthnot; 1758 by Whytt; 1762 by Baker and Rutty; 1767 by
Heberden; 1775 by Fothergill, who collected observations from many
physicians; in 1782 by Gray, Haygath and Carmichael Smith; 1803 by
Pearson and Falconer, and a great number of others; 1833 by Hingeston
and others; 1837 by Streeten, Graves, and Bryson, etc.; 1847 by
Peacock, Laycock and many others; also those of 1855 and 1889–93.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Stallybrass, epidemic crests have been reached in
England in 1789–90, 1802–03, 1830–32, 1840–41, 1848–51, 1854,
1869–70, 1879, 1890–91, 1898 and 1918 to 1920. The periodicity in
multiples of ten years in this latter group is remarkable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The disease appears to have visited North America in the years
1627, 1647, 1729, 1732, 1737, 1762, 1782, 1789, 1811, 1832, 1850, 1857,
1860, 1874, 1879, 1889, 1900, 1915–1916 and 1918–20. Abbott
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>speaks particularly of the years 1647, 1655 and 1697–98, 1732, 1762
and 1782 and 1889 as being years of especial epidemic prevalence in
this country.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Clinical and Epidemiologic Identification.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>Up to the present time we have discovered no one characteristic
by which we may say that a case or an epidemic is positively influenza.
We have had to rely on the general symptomatology, which indeed
is sufficiently characteristic, although so nearly like the symptoms of
certain other diseases as to make us hesitate to make an absolute
diagnosis, and on the epidemic characteristics. The necessity of an
absolute criterion in the clinical diagnosis is particularly felt in the
presence of an isolated interepidemic case, or a small endemic outbreak.
It is at this point that the opinions of epidemiologists diverge,
a divergence which results in two schools of thought in the explanation
of the endemic source of epidemic influenza. Are the interepidemic
cases and the small localized epidemics due to the virus which causes
the great pandemics; are they <i>influenza vera</i>, or are they entirely
different diseases with similar symptomatology, caused by some other
microorganism and should they be designated by some other name?
Thus Leichtenstern remarks: “When we go over the records of the
years 1173 to 1875, and particularly those of the last century, when
the information has been more extensive and more accurate, we find
that scarcely a year has passed without news of the epidemic occurrence
of influenza at some point or other of the earth. Some of these
local and territorial epidemics are merely endemic recurrences of the
great pandemics which have left the germ deposited in the various
localities. Others of these small epidemics probably have nothing
to do with <i>influenza vera</i>, but are local outbreaks of <i>catarrhal fever</i>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Contrary to the usual belief, influenza is a disease of quite definite
and distinct characteristics, both clinical and epidemiological. The
symptoms are clear cut, with sudden onset, severe prostration out of
all proportion to the clinical symptoms and to the fever, headache
and pain in the back, general body pains, and fever of greater or less
degree. There is usually a lack of leucocytosis or a true leucopenia.
In uncomplicated influenza there are as a rule no localizing symptoms.
There may be a slight soreness of the throat, or a slight cough, but
these are at best mild. The fever lasts from three to five days and
disappears, while at the same time all of the symptoms clear up with
the exception of the profound prostration, which as a rule continues
for some time, rendering convalescence surprisingly slow. The pain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>in the back may remain for a week or so. This is the description of
uncomplicated influenza.</p>

<p class='c007'>The manner of spread of epidemic influenza is constant in a primary
epidemic and the epidemic as a whole has certain features which
render it characteristic. The sporadic case has as a rule the same quite
clear cut clinical symptomatology, but it fails to manifest the one
feature most characteristic of epidemic influenza—a high degree of
contagiousness. Further, although the symptoms in themselves are
characteristic, there is no one pathognomonic sign by which one may
say, “this is a case of influenza,” and, finally other disease conditions
such as tonsillitis, frequently resemble it so much as to cause error in
diagnosis.</p>

<p class='c007'>This becomes, then, one of the problems in the study of influenza
epidemiology. It is a matter of first importance to determine once
and for all whether true influenza is with us always, or whether it
appears only at the time of the great pandemics. Upon the answer to
this question more than upon any other one thing rests our choice of
methods of eradication. Any procedures of preventive medicine that
may be undertaken on the assumption that the source of pandemic
influenza is to be found in one or a few endemic foci, such as the one
supposed to exist in Turkestan, would fail utterly should the true
condition be that of a universal distribution of a relatively avirulent
virus which from time to time from some unknown cause assumes a
highly increased virulence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before becoming involved in this very complicated question, let
us familiarize ourselves completely with the characteristics of the
pandemic and epidemic variety of the disease.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>General Characteristics of Early Epidemic Outbreaks.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>We have described the symptomatology of uncomplicated influenza.
It is rare that this clinical picture is seen alone during the height of
an epidemic. Complications, chiefly of the respiratory tract, as a rule
occur in such a large proportion of individuals that they very nearly
dominate the picture. Although caused by various microorganisms,
all of which appear to be secondary factors the results are so characteristic
that in the past, descriptions of influenza epidemics have usually
been descriptions of the complications of epidemic influenza. Most
influenza epidemics are complicated. But we do know from the
experience of recent years as well as from history that relatively
uncomplicated epidemics of influenza have occurred, and that when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>they do so occur a predominant characteristic has been the extreme
mildness.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a fundamental characteristic of pandemic influenza that
early cases in widespread epidemics, as well as in “pre-epidemic
increases” are very mild, with a minimum of respiratory complications
and with exceedingly low mortality. It is because we are better
acquainted with the more severe variety that, when these mild precursors
appear we are always in doubt for a time as to their true
identity.</p>

<p class='c007'>In spite of our 20th century erudition, the influenza when it first
appeared in mild form in the American Expeditionary Forces in 1918,
for a lack of better knowledge as to its cause was called “three-day
fever.” In Italy in the same year the designation of the disease progressed
from pappataci fever through “Spanish grip” and “summer
influenza,” until finally it was designated influenza, pure and simple.
Sampietro in Italy particularly discussed the possibility of the disease
being pappataci fever.</p>

<p class='c007'>Belogu and Saccone, who wrote in May of 1918, decided that the
epidemic was not influenza in spite of the manifest clinical similarity,
chiefly because of the absence of signs of secondary invasion, such as
nervous symptoms, gastro-intestinal symptoms, and pneumonia, and
especially because of the rapid recovery after defervescence. They also
considered the possibility of pappataci fever and dengue, and ruled
out both. They discussed calling the condition “influenza nostras,”
but reached no definite conclusion. Trench fever was also considered
by some. United States Public Health Reports for 1918 record that
dengue was reported prevalent at Chefoo, China, during the two weeks
ended June 15th, 1918. One week later there was a paragraph stating,
“Prevalence of a disease resembling dengue and affecting about
fifty per cent. of the population was reported at Shanghai, China,
June 15, 1918.” It is not impossible that this was influenza.</p>

<p class='c007'>Zinsser reminds us that Hayfelder, when he saw the influenza as
it spread in Petrograd in November of 1889, remarked its close clinical
similarity to the description of an epidemic of dengue which had
prevailed in Constantinople during the preceding September. Hayfelder,
in studying the 1889 epidemic at its onset in Russia and the
East, wrote of “Sibirisches Fieber” which was first looked upon as
malaria owing to the apparently complete absence of the complicating
lesions habitually associated in our minds with influenza.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same difficulty in early identification was experienced in this
country in 1918. At the end of March of that year the author who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>was stationed at Camp Sevier, South Carolina, was one of a Board of
Officers appointed to investigate a disease which had broken out among
troops stationed at that camp. At that time the line troops consisted
of three infantry regiments and three machine gun battalions. On the
day following a parade in the city of Greenville a considerable number
of men in three out of the six organizations suddenly took ill. There
were a few isolated cases in other organizations, but in the one infantry
regiment and two machine gun battalions the regimental infirmaries
were filled, and some cases were sent to the base hospital. Nearly all
were very mildly ill and exhibited the symptoms of pure uncomplicated
influenza as described above. The onset was sudden, there were the
usual pains and aches, the bowels were regular, there was a feeling of
discomfort in the pit of the stomach in many instances, and there were
no sore throats and very little cough. Recovery was as a rule very
rapid, although about a dozen of the entire number developed pneumonia
and some of these died. Physical examination of those only
mildly ill and who remained in the regimental infirmary showed as a
rule nothing, but in some instances scattered fine moist rales near the
hilus of the lungs. In some of the organizations the disease was
definitely spread down rows of company tents. Careful bacteriologic
examination was made at the time and the predominating organisms
were found to be a gram-negative coccus resembling micrococcus
catarrhalis, and a non-hemolytic streptococcus. This was in uncomplicated
cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Board decided that the disease should be called influenza,
but our only basis for such decision were the clinical symptoms and
the contagious character. At that time none of us dreamed of any
possible connection with a severe epidemic to occur later, and laboratory
search for influenza bacilli which was carefully made in view of
the clinical diagnosis showed none of these organisms to be present.</p>

<p class='c007'>At about the same time a similar epidemic was being experienced
at Fort Oglethorpe, Ga. V. C. Vaughan, in describing this epidemic,
remarks: “A disease strongly resembling influenza became prevalent
in the Oglethorpe Camp about March 18, 1918. It soon assumed
pandemic proportions. Within two weeks every organization in Camp
Forrest and the Reserve Officers Training Camp was affected.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The symptoms were as follows: Headache, pain in the bones and
muscles, especially the muscles of the back, marked prostration, fever,
sometimes as high as 104 degrees. Sometimes there was conjunctivitis,
coryza, a rash and possibly nausea, recovery taking place in a
few days.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>“In all organizations the epidemic was first located in companies
before it became general.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The incubation period was short, not over one or two days.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Some organizations suffered more than others for no apparent
reason.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is probable that the epidemic disease was recently brought to
these camps. If it is genuine influenza, and the epidemiological
features no less than the leading symptoms seem to point to that
disease, there is here offered the most reasonable explanation of the
outbreak which is now possible. No other disease spreads so fast or
is so prostrating, considering its symptoms.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We will quote at some length from the report of Zinsser of the
Chaumont epidemic in France in 1918, because of the excellence of the
description, and particularly because Zinsser has followed three
successive epidemics with successive increases in the complications
and corresponding transformations in the clinical picture. It is
worthy of special note that he has remarked that the influenza, as
first seen at Chaumont, showed nothing in the symptoms that would
suggest a predominant respiratory tract infection.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It will be useful to discuss briefly the early cases as we saw them
during the Chaumont epidemic, not because the observations made
there add much that is new from a clinical point of view, but because
they will remove any possible ambiguity concerning our conception
of influenza in its pure uncomplicated form.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As far as we can judge the little outbreak at headquarters was
typical of the first advent of epidemic influenza in many places. The
population of the town, at the time, consisted of a large office personnel
attached to the military administration, scattered as to billets and
places of work; of military units living in barracks and eating at common
messes; and of the townspeople. The epidemic descended upon
individual military units with the suddenness of a storm, striking a
considerable percentage of the men, perhaps most of the susceptible
material, within less than a week, and ending almost as abruptly,
with only a few isolated cases trailing behind. Among the more
scattered office workers and among the townspeople it was disseminated
more gradually and trailed along for a longer period.</p>

<p class='c007'>“These early cases were clinically so uniform that a diagnosis
could be made from the history alone. The onset was almost uniformly
abrupt. Typical cases would become ill suddenly during the
night or at a given hour in the day. A patient who had been perfectly
well on going to bed, would suddenly awake with a severe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>headache, chilliness, malaise and fever. Others would arise feeling
perfectly well in the morning, and at some time during the day would
become aware of headache and pains in the somatic muscles.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The typical course of these cases may be exemplified by that of
J. T. W., a draftsman attached to the 29th Engineers. He was
perfectly well until May 20th, working regularly, his bowels and
appetite normal, considering himself healthy. On May 21st, at
4:30 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span> he awoke with a severe headache. He arose, forced himself
to eat breakfast and tried to go to work. He began to feel feverish
and chilly. At the same time his headache became worse, with pains
in the back, and burning in the eye balls. At 2 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> he reported sick,
and was taken to the hospital with a temperature of 102.8 degrees.
At midnight his temperature dropped to 101.6 degrees, and came
down to normal by noon of the 22d. As he recovered he developed a
slight sore throat, great soreness of the legs and a very slight cough.
He recovered completely within a few days.</p>

<p class='c007'>“These cases with a few exceptions developed no rashes. One or
two of them had blotchy red eruptions which we felt incompetent to
characterize dermatologically. The leucocyte counts ranged from
5,000 to 9,000. A very few went above this. Sometimes there was a
relative increase of lymphocytes, but this was by no means regular.
The few spinal fluids that were examined were normal. As to enlargement
of the spleen, we can say nothing definitely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Soon after this we observed the disease in a Division, the 42d,
then holding a part of the line in front of Baccarat. Here it had
already developed a somewhat different nature, due, we believe, to the
fact that the men of this Division were not, as were those at Chaumont,
living in a rest area, but were actively engaged in military operations,
working, sleeping, and eating under conditions that involved
greater fatigue, less protection against weather, and greater crowding
in sleeping quarters. The Baccarat cases were much more frequently
catarrhal; sore throats, coughs and more serious respiratory complications
were more common. However, they were usually coupled
unmistakably with an underlying typical influenzal attack, sudden
onset, pains and short lived fever. Moreover, there were a great
many of the entirely uncomplicated cases interspersed with the
others.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Still later, in September, October and November, respiratory
complications were so frequent and severe, came on so early in the
disease, and the pneumonia mortality became so high, that the fundamental
identity of these later cases with the early three-day fever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>might easily have been lost sight of by observers who had not followed
the gradual transformation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In consideration of these facts, it is apparent that etiological or
other investigations can throw no light upon the problems of influenza
unless they are carried out with clearer understanding of the differentiation
between the complications and the basic disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The serious respiratory infections of the bronchi and lungs we
can set down with reasonable certainty as complications due, certainly
in the overwhelming majority of cases, to secondary bacterial invaders.
It is a matter of considerable difficulty, however, to know exactly
where the basic disease stops and the complications begin; and whether
we must regard the mild sore throat and conjunctival injection which
so often accompany the simple cases as a part of this basic clinical
picture, or as the simplest variety of complication. This is much
more than an academic question, since, as we shall see, the bacteriological
analyses of such lesions have played an important role in
etiological investigations.”</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Symptoms in Former Epidemics.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>The difficulty in making a decision in the presence of an epidemic
is very similar to that of deciding whether the epidemics of former
times were in each case influenza. Some few have been recorded in
which the description has corresponded fairly well to that of primary
uncomplicated influenza. Thus, concerning the epidemic of 1557 in
Spain, Thomas Short wrote as follows: “At Mantua Carpentaria,
three miles from Madrid, the epidemic began in August.... There
it began with a roughness of the jaws, small cough, then a strong fever
with a pain of the head, back, and legs. Some felt as though they
were corded over the breast and had a weight at the stomach, all of
which continued to the third day at furthest. Then the fever went
off, with a sweat or bleeding at the nose. In some few, it turned to a
pleurisy or fatal peripneumony.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Most of the descriptions, however, have been of a general character
and include descriptions of the complicated periods of the epidemic.
One of the more complete of the early descriptions was that by Lobineau
in 1414, who wrote: “<span lang="fr">C’était une espèce de rhume, qui causa un
tel enrouement que les chastelets furent obligez d’interrompre leurs
séances; on dormoit peu et l’on souffroit de grandes douleurs à la teste,
aux reins et par tout le reste du corps; mais le mal ne fut mortel que
pour les vieilles gens de toute condition.</span>”</p>

<p class='c007'>With this exception we possess no very good or complete description
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>of influenza prior to the epidemic of 1510. After that time they
have as a rule been detailed enough to enable identification. Hirsch
bases his conclusions concerning the year 1173 chiefly on the following
quotation: “<span lang="la">Sub hisdem diebus universus orbus infectus ex aeris
nebulosa corruptione, stomacho catarrhum causante generalem tussim,
ad singulorum perniciem, ad mortem etiam plurimorum immissam
vehementer expavite.</span>” Nearly all that we have to go on in this
description is the widespread incidence of the disease and the presence
of respiratory symptoms, particularly cough. In 1323 the description
emphasizes only the high morbidity. Thus, Pietro Buoninsegni writes:
“<span lang="it">In questo anno e d’Agosto fu un vento pestilenzia le per lo quale
amalò di freddo e di febbre per alcuni dì quasi tutte le persone in Firenze
e questo madesimo fu quais per tutta Italia.</span>” The same author
describes the epidemic of 1327, emphasizing again the high morbidity
and in addition the low death rate: “<span lang="it">In detto anno e mese fu quasi
per tutto Italia corruzione di febbre per freddo; ma pochi ne morirono.</span>”
Again in 1387, he emphasizes the same two features.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pasquier, in writing of the epidemic of 1403 in France, says: “<span lang="fr">En
Registres de Parlement on trouve que le vingt-sixième jour d’avril
1403 y eut une maladie de teste et de toux, qui courut universellement
si grande, que ce jour-là le Greffier ne pût rien enrégistrer et
fut-on contraint d’abandonner le plaidoyé.</span>” Here the high morbidity
and the symptoms, particularly cough and pain, are emphasized. In
1414, Baliolanus describes again the high morbidity and symptoms,
particularly cough and hoarseness: “<span lang="la">Eoque frigore humanis corporibus
concepto&#160;... tussis maxima atque raucitas orta unde nullus pene
ordo, aetas et sexus liber evasit.</span>” In 1411, Pasquier writes the following:
“<span lang="fr">En 1411 y eut une autre sorte de maladie dont une infinité de
personnes furent touchez, par laquelle l’on perdoit le boire, le manger et
le dormir&#160;... toujours trembloit et avec le estoit si las et rompu
que l’on ne l’osoit toucher en quelques parts. Sans qu’aucune
personne en mourut.</span>”</p>

<p class='c007'>Subsequent to 1510 descriptions have been as a rule more definite.
There are, however, exceptions to this statement and these fall in the
epidemics concerning which there is some dispute.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Manner of Spread.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>More characteristic and more important from an epidemiologic
standpoint than the symptomatology in general, as we have discussed
it, is the mode of development of the epidemic as a whole.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span><i>Human intercourse.</i>—Before the days of bacteriology the contagiousness
of the disease was little discussed. Its infectiveness was in
fact not universally established until the epidemic of 1889–1890. One
of the first writers who attempted to see in the influenza a contagious
disease was Ch. Calenus who wrote in 1579: “<span lang="la">Contagiosum dico
morbum, quia etsi quidem ab occulta quadam coeli influentia, principaliter
eum profisci haud dubium est&#160;... eo in loco quo jam
grassabatur inter homines citius eos invadabat, qui cum affectis frequenter
conversabantur, quam eos, qui a consuetudine affectorum
studiose abstinebant.</span>” This keen observer saw that those who
carelessly exposed themselves to close contact with cases of influenza
were more likely to develop the disease than those who protected
themselves in every way possible. The “contagious” school first
developed in England, where Haygarth, Hamilton, Gray, Hull,
Duggard, Bardsley, and others, in 1775–1803 described the disease as
being not in the air, but in a specific contagion. Others who considered
influenza a contagious disease were Simonin, Lombard, Petit de Corbeil
(1837), Blanc (1860), and Bertholle (1876).</p>

<p class='c007'>Watson (1847) quotes Cullen as saying that this species of catarrh
proceeds from contagion. He, himself, is not convinced of this fact.
He says the visitation is too sudden and too widely spread to be capable
of explanation in that way. “There are facts in the history of influenza
which furnish a strong presumption that the exciting cause
of the disorder is material, not a mere quality of the atmosphere; and
that it is at least <i>portable</i>. The instances are very numerous, too
numerous to be attributed to mere chance, in which the complaint
has first broken out in those particular houses of a town at which
travelers have recently arrived from infected places.... What
I wish to point out now is the fact that the influenza pervades large
tracts of country in a manner much too sudden and simultaneous to
be consistent with the notion that its prevalence depends exclusively
upon any contagious properties that it may possess.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Parkes, writing in Reynolds’ System of Medicine in 1876, views the
subject more as we see it today: “The rapidity of the spread would
seem at once to negative any connection between human intercourse
and the propagation of the disease; yet there is some affirmative
evidence. It does not appear to follow the great lines of commerce;
but when it has entered towns and villages in which the investigation
can be carried on, it is curious how frequently the first cases have been
introduced, and how often the townspeople nearest the invalids have
been first affected. In this country especially, Haygarth in 1775 and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>1782, and Falconer in 1802, collected so many instances of this that
they became convinced that its propagation was due entirely to
human intercourse. So also, when it passes through a house, it
occasionally attacks one person after another. But if it is introduced
in this way it afterwards develops with marvelous rapidity, for we
cannot discredit the accounts of many thousands of persons being
attacked within a day or two, which is quite different from the comparatively
slow spread of the contagious diseases. This <i>sudden</i>
invasion of a community makes it, to many persons, appear highly
improbable that any effluvia passing off from the sick should thus so
rapidly contaminate the atmosphere of a whole town.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Still, we must remember how singularly, of late years, the knowledge
of the introduction of cholera by persons coming from infected
districts has increased, and how very striking are the instances of this
kind already recorded in several works on influenza.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In some cases, again, isolation or seclusion of a community, as
in prisons, has given immunity; or at least that community has not
been attacked.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The great rapidity of spread has caused even in 1918 some temporary
doubt as to the contagiousness of the disease. Thus, Zinsser
wrote:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The opinion of direct and indirect transmission from man to man
is also well supported by a detailed study of the epidemiology of
individual outbreaks. In our own experience with epidemics such as
those at Chaumont, Baccarat and other places, the suddenness with
which the malady attacked large numbers of people at almost one and
the same time, caused me at first to be exceedingly skeptical of accepting
transmission by contact as the only means of conveyance. We
considered food and insect transmission as possibilities, and tried
our best to find grounds for involving such agencies. But in every
case we were forced to return to the conclusion that direct and
indirect contact between men came nearest to doing justice to all
observed facts.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There have been many examples reported from personal experience
to show that influenza is transmitted from man to man. Two objections,
however, have had to be met, before this view was generally
accepted. First, it has been claimed by some that the disease spread
more rapidly from an assumed focus than individuals could travel,
and second, that instances were on record of cases occurring spontaneously
in isolated communities. Yet a third argument formerly raised
against the contagious character of the disease was the claim that it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>broke out in mass attacks, that large numbers became ill on the same
day without the occurrence of isolated antecedent cases. The splendid
work of epidemiologists following the 1889 epidemic appears to have
answered all of these objections. Many, such as Leichtenstern, have
gone into great detail on this subject. In fact, at that time this was the
question of greatest importance. Today we assume the correctness
of the hypothesis, and pass on to consideration of other subjects of
more recent development. We will, therefore, review very hurriedly
some of the evidence quoted to prove that influenza is transmitted
only from man to man and only by human intercourse.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Isolated places.</i>—Has it ever been shown that individuals completely
isolated from communication with communities where influenza is
present have, during an epidemic, developed the disease? Leichtenstern,
after a comprehensive review, concludes as follows: “We have
not a single example on record where influenza has attacked individuals
in completely isolated localities, as on mountain tops and mountain
passes. Study of this has been undertaken in Switzerland by F.
Schmid. The same has been true of ships at sea, as has been shown
chiefly from the English Marine Reports. There have been reports of
influenza occurring in mid-ocean and particularly in the earlier epidemics,
but the information has been insufficient.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Parkes at even an earlier period observed: “I cannot but consider
that we require better evidence of ships being attacked in mid-ocean.
In some of the quoted instances the ships had been at a port either
known to be infected or in which influenza was really present, although
it had not become epidemic. As we are ignorant of the exact period
of incubation some men may have been infected before sailing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Critical investigation into stories of spontaneous infection in
isolated localities such as ships at sea and island lighthouses will quite
invariably demonstrate that these popular reports have been distortions
of the actual facts. One or two examples will suffice. Abbott
records an example: “An impression having gained some credence
that influenza had appeared on board the squadron of naval vessels
which sailed from Boston in December, 1889, while on their course
across the Atlantic and before their arrival in Europe, a letter was
addressed by the writer to the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery of the
United States Navy for information upon this point, to which a reply
was received, as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The ‘Chicago,’ ‘Boston,’ ‘Atlanta’ and ‘Yorktown’ left Boston
December 7, 1889, for Lisbon, Portugal. The first three arrived at
Lisbon on December 21st without having touched at any port <i><span lang="fr">en route</span></i>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>The ‘Yorktown’ arrived at that port December 23d, having, stopped
about twenty-four hours at Fayal, Azores.... Influenza first
appeared on the ‘Chicago’ December 23d, on the ‘Boston’ December
28th, on the ‘Atlanta’ December 30th and on the ‘Yorktown’
December 28th.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Influenza was prevailing in Lisbon at the date of arrival of the
squadron.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In March, 1920, the author was notified of a somewhat similar
story which he undertook to trace. The results show well the
inaccuracy of verbal transmission through several individuals. A
letter was first sent to the Quarantine Officer at Portland, Maine:
“It has been reported to us that in a lighthouse just outside of Portland,
Maine, there has been a rather interesting prank played by
influenza. We are told that three men and one woman live in the
lighthouse; that during the 1918 influenza epidemic the woman contracted
the disease while none of the men became sick, and that in the
present epidemic all three of the men became sick with the disease and
the woman remained well. It was claimed that they had had no
communication with the mainland for some time before the men
became ill,” etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reply was as follows: “I have inquired of the Light House
Inspector’s office in Portland and they know of no stations to which
the terms of your inquiry would apply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At the Boon Island station, there are three keepers with families.
At the Half Way Rock station, there are three keepers but no woman.
The Inspector does not seem to know of any station where there are
three men and one woman.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A second letter, sent to the Inspector of Lighthouses at Portland
brought corroborative information:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Boon Island Light Station was stricken by this epidemic in
the following manner: The keeper, his wife and five children were all
stricken, the keeper himself having had the hardest battle, having
apparently been subject to same while ashore in Portsmouth, N. H.
after provisions, supplies, etc. The 2d assistant’s wife and two children
were also stricken, but the 2d assistant, himself, and the 1st
assistant keeper did not contract the malady in spite of the fact that
they were all confined on a small island working together at the station.</p>

<p class='c007'>“During the year 1920 none of the keepers or their families, consisting
of thirteen in number, were affected. The Halfway Rock
Light Station where three keepers are employed did not contract this
malady either in the years 1918 or 1920.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>“For your information I might add that during the inspection trip
in the months of January, February and March, 1920, all of the light
stations in this district were visited, and it was found that they were all
enjoying good health and had not been visited by the epidemic, with
the possible exception of three stations which are located either on the
mainland or close to where the keeper or his family were able to visit
the nearby cities or towns.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Although it has not been shown that completely isolated places
have been visited by the disease, there is abundant evidence that
such places have remained influenza free as long as the isolation has
remained complete. Islands and lighthouses, which have not been in
communication with the mainland, individuals living isolated on
mountain tops, and ships at sea remained free from influenza even in
the presence of a pandemic, as long as they did not come into communication
with individuals sick with the disease. The following
places remained free from influenza throughout the 1889 epidemic: the
Isle of Man, several of the islands of the West Indies, particularly
the Bahamas, Granada and St. Lucia, also the British Honduras,
British Guiana, and the Seychelle Islands.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even in 1918, when the paths of commerce reached nearly every
portion of the world, we have examples of relative immunity of isolated
places. Thus we know that the Esquimaux were attacked late in the
course of the pandemic, and we have the statement of Barthélemy who
traveled in 1919 to some of the oasis towns of the Sahara Desert, and
there discovered that there had not only been no influenza up to that
time, but also that they had not even heard of the pandemic.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another type of isolated place is the closed institution. As early
as 1709, Lancisi remarked that the prisons of the Inquisition in Rome
remained free from influenza. Twenty-one prisons in Germany in
1889–90 remained entirely free from the disease. This was true of 39
prisons in England, some of which were in cities where the epidemic
was most extensive. Linroth, who observed this same phenomenon in
Sweden, makes the wise remark that, “the influenza conquers more
easily the space of 500 to 1,000 kilometers than it does the small barrier
made by a prison wall.” A convent in Charlottenburg housing one
hundred women remained entirely free during the 1889–90 epidemic.</p>

<p class='c007'>As a rule institutions of this sort have been unable to maintain a
complete quarantine throughout the period of an epidemic, and the
relative immunity has been demonstrated more in late invasions, at a
time when the restrictions have become somewhat lax. Thus, in 1918,
Winslow and Rogers, report that in an orphan asylum in New Haven,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Connecticut, which had completely escaped during the month of
October when the epidemic was at its height, one of the Sisters and
the priest in charge came down with influenza about December 15th.
By the 27th of December 127 cases had occurred in the institution
within twenty-four hours, and by January 7th there had been 424
cases, with seven deaths out of a total population of 464. The probable
source of the sudden outbreak of December 27th seems to have been
the Sister first affected who, when convalescent, resumed her duties
in the kitchen, which included the inspection and handling of the milk
given out to the children.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Crowd gatherings.</i>—Yet another phenomenon which would lead us
to conclude that human intercourse is the most potent factor in the
transmission of influenza is the fact that there is frequently a high
increase in the influenza rate following crowd gatherings. Parkes
observed long ago that persons in overcrowded habitations, particularly
in some epidemics, suffered especially, and several instances are
on record of a large school or a barracks being first attacked and the
disease prevailing there for some days, before it became prevalent in
the towns around.</p>

<p class='c007'>In England, the weekly market played an important role in the
spread of the disease in 1889. One frequently saw such reports as
that: “The first case of influenza was a man who went to London
daily.” Or, “All the earliest cases were men going to London daily,
while their wives and families were later affected.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the epidemics at San Quentin Prison, it was noted that apices
of incidence usually occurred on Tuesday and Wednesday. During
the first epidemic it was these days of the second and third weeks.
Stanley sees a direct connection between this fact and the fact that
every Sunday morning large groups of the men were crowded together
in a comparatively small auditorium where they saw moving pictures.
On Sunday, October 20th, they sought to eliminate this source of
spread by having a band concert in the open air, but the prisoners
crowded around the band and were loud in their cheers, and on the
following day there was a large increase in hospital admissions.</p>

<p class='c007'>On November 24th after the second epidemic had apparently
ceased the picture shows were again started after having been closed
for over six weeks. The following Tuesday and Wednesday twenty-four
well defined new cases were admitted to the hospital. On
Thanksgiving Day there was a field meet between the various departments
of the prison. About 200 prisoners took active part, while
1,600 prisoners were spectators. The meet was held in the open air,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>but the prisoners were closely packed and they cheered and yelled.
For the three days following this celebration there were 9, 5 and 8
patients admitted respectively.</p>

<p class='c007'>In discussing the recrudescence of influenza in Boston in November
and December, Woodward remarks as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whether or not it may be more than a succession of coincidences
it is certainly of interest to note that the November outbreak of
influenza showed itself three days after the Peace Day celebration on
November 12th, when the streets, eating places and public conveyances
were jammed with crowds; that the December epidemic began
to manifest itself after the Thanksgiving holiday, with its family
re-unions and visiting; and that reported cases mounted rapidly
during the period of Christmas shopping, reaching a maximum a week
after the holiday.” That this may have been a coincidence is indicated
by the fact that, according to reports by Pearl and others this
was not consistently true in other large cities.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Meredith Davies records the case of a hostel in Wales accommodating
200 students. Infection was introduced on October 19th on
the occasion of a dance attended by some students from an infected
institution in the neighborhood. Four cases occurred on the 20th
and within the short space of five days seventy-nine students out of
the 200 were attacked.</p>

<p class='c007'>Parsons found numerous similar examples in the epidemic of 1889.
In 1918 it was frequently observed that among American Soldiers in
France, those troops quartered in barracks suffered a much more rapid
spread of the disease than those billetted out among the houses of the
towns.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Mass attack.</i>—Another argument formerly raised against the
contagious character was the claim that it broke out in mass attack,
and large numbers became ill on the same day without the occurrence
of isolated antecedent cases. The first cases of such epidemic diseases
as the plague and small pox became a matter of record because of the
accompanying high mortality, while in influenza, with its relatively
low death rate the record usually begins only after a comparatively
large mass of individuals have been attacked.</p>

<p class='c007'>Watson in 1847 observed as follows: “Although the general
descent of the malady is, as I have said, very sudden and diffused,
scattered cases of it, like the first droppings of a thunder shower, have
usually been remembered as having preceded it. The disorder is
most violent at the commencement of the visitation; then its severity
abates; and the epidemic is mostly over in about six weeks. Yet the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>morbific influence would seem to have a longer duration. In a given
place nearly all the inhabitants who are susceptible of the distemper
suffer it within that period, or become proof against its power. But
strangers, who, after that period, arrive from uninfected places have
not, apparently, the same immunity.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Parkes in 1876 observed that, “When the disease enters a town it
has occasionally attacked numbers of the inhabitants almost simultaneously.
But more frequently its course is somewhat slower; it
attacks a few families first and then in a few days rapidly spreads;
the accounts of thousands of persons being at once attacked at the
onset of the disease are chiefly taken from the older records, in which
the suddenness of the outbreak is exaggerated. Frequently, perhaps
always, in a great city the outbreak is made up by a number of localized
attacks, certain streets or districts being more affected than others, or
being for a time solely affected, and in this way it successively passes
to different parts of the city. It has generally occurred in a great city
before appearing in the smaller towns and villages round it and sometimes
these towns, though in the neighborhood, have not been invaded
for some weeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In some cases and perhaps a large number, it breaks out after
persons ill with influenza have arrived from infected places.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The decline in any great town is less rapid than its rise, and
usually occupies from four to six weeks, or sometimes longer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Detailed studies of the Munich epidemic of 1889 and numerous
similar studies of the recent epidemic, which will be referred to later,
have shown a period of two or three weeks of steadily increasing
numbers of cases before the height of the epidemic was reached.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Droplet infection and spread through inanimate objects.</i>—The actual
mode of spread of the virus of influenza from one individual to another
is unknown. The more generally accepted explanation is that the
infecting agent leaves the body through the respiratory tract, usually
in the spray of coughing or talking; contagion is by droplet infection,
as is sometimes the case in other respiratory infections. Thorne and
others have called attention to the capillary congestion of the conjunctivae
very early in the disease. They suggest that possibly the
mucous membrane of the eye is the site of infection.</p>

<p class='c007'>There has recently been considerable discussion concerning the
spread of influenza through inanimate objects.</p>

<p class='c007'>Leichtenstern reviews the reports of 1889–93 in which influenza
was supposed to have been transmitted through wares, merchandise
and other inanimate objects. He concluded that the evidence in all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>of the cases cited was insufficient for conclusive proof. Such an
example was the supposed importation of the disease in goods sent
from Russia to the Grands Magazins du Louvre at Paris. In one day
100 people became ill and in a few more 500 were sick with influenza.
The explanation was that the germs had been imported in goods sent
from Russia to the store. Detailed investigation showed that this
could not have been the case because no goods had been received
from Russia for a period of three years. Another example is that of
one of the two winter caretakers at the St. Gothard Hospice. One of
the two men went down into the valley where he purchased supplies.
Ten days after his return the man who had remained in the Hospice fell
ill with influenza while his comrade remained well. It was stated
that influenza was introduced into Basel by goods shipped to that
place from the Magazins du Louvre in Paris. The first case occurred in
a man who had been working at unpacking these goods.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lynch and Cumming believe that droplet infection plays but a
minor role in the spread of sputum-borne diseases, but that insanitary
methods of washing dishes and eating utensils was the chief cause for
the high rates of “sputum-borne” infections both in army and civilian
life in 1918. They found that among 31,000 troops eating from
tableware which was cleaned by kitchen police, the influenza rate was
51 per 1,000, while among 35,000 eating from mess kits which each
individual washed himself the rate was 252 per 1,000. “Eighty-four
per cent. of the cases occurred among those whose hands were contaminated
by washing their own eating utensils.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Among 17,236 employees of hotels, restaurants and department
stores, who ate from machine washed dishes, there occurred 349 cases
of influenza, while among 4,175 who ate from hand washed dishes
there were 429 cases. The rate was but 20 per 1,000 in the former,
while in the latter group it reached 103 per 1,000. Here again the
chances of infection between the two groups were as one is to five.</p>

<p class='c007'>These authors have records covering 252,186 individuals in scattered
institutions in the United States. Among those eating from
machine washed dishes the rate was 108 per 1,000 while those eating
from hand washed dishes suffered at the rate of 324 per 1,000. The
ratio was 1 to 3 between the two groups. Seventy-five per cent. of
the cases occurred in that group which ate from dishes not disinfected
with boiling water. They do not state the number of individuals in
each of the two groups.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lynch and Cumming claim that in the act of coughing only a few
organisms are expelled from the mouth, rarely over 1,500, and conclude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>that transmission by direct contact through the air route but
rarely, if ever, takes place. While about 1,500 organisms are expelled
onto the floor by an act of coughing, a sterile glove wiped across the
lips may pick up nearly 2,000,000 organisms. Such organisms may
be readily transferred to inanimate objects which are handled by
many people.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci may be isolated with
great regularity from the hands of carriers or patients, from table
ware, inanimate objects touched by these patients, and from floor
dust. Diphtheria and tubercle bacilli have been isolated from the
hands and eating utensils of patients. The average count of a large
number of restaurant dishwater specimens was 4,000,000 bacteria per
c.c. The temperature of this water averaged 43° C. and the dishes
were practically never scalded. The water was often so highly polluted,
“that the dishes are more highly contaminated after they are
washed than before washing begins. The spoon or fork is often freer
from organisms just after being used by the restaurant patron
than when taken from the restaurant’s polluted dish water.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Major John S. Billings, epidemiologist at Camp Custer, reported
that one of the larger organizations did not properly observe the regulation
requiring that all mess kits and table equipment be properly
sterilized. The disease appeared early and spread unusually rapidly
in this particular organization.</p>

<p class='c007'>In summarizing the subject of transmission through utensils, we
may say that the evidence is suggestive but inconclusive. It is possible,
even probable, that this is one mode of transmission. That it
is the most important has not been proved. Lynch and Cumming
do not take into consideration that the regiments with more sanitary
methods of cleansing the dishes are apt to be those regiments with
more sanitary habits throughout their daily routine. Those restaurants
using mechanical dish washers are usually the cleaner restaurants.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pontano in Italy is quoted by the Office International d’Hygiène
Publique as having observed in his epidemiological study that there was
a constant connection between the living conditions and the severity of
the complications. Notable differences were observed in neighboring
houses according to the hygienic conditions of the various households.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Healthy carriers and convalescents.</i>—Leichtenstern, who apparently
accepted the Pfeiffer bacillus as the cause of influenza, did not believe
that the disease could be transmitted by healthy carriers. He based
this assumption on the statement, made by Pfeiffer, that the influenza
bacillus was only found in acute influenza cases. In the past few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>years it has been abundantly shown, however, that the influenza
bacillus can and does exist on the mucous membranes of healthy
individuals.</p>

<p class='c007'>The outbreak in an orphan asylum in New Haven has been previously
described. There the probable source of the sharp outbreak
of December 27th seemed to be the sister who, on convalescence,
resumed her duties in the kitchen. There she inspected and handled
the milk served to the children. This suggests the possibility of
infection being propagated by convalescents and by food.</p>

<p class='c007'>At present we do not know whether or not a patient remains
infectious after the acute symptoms have subsided; we are ignorant
as to whether a convalescent patient can transmit the disease; and we
are not certain whether the organism found in healthy carriers is
virulent or not. The information at hand strongly indicates that
apparently healthy individuals may transmit the infection, but
the wide distribution of the disease, with multiple possible sources
of infection for each individual, and the relative insusceptibility of
experimentally exposed individuals has made it impossible so far to
answer these questions satisfactorily.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>General Manner of Spread in Individual Localities.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>Having discussed the mode of propagation of influenza among
individuals we will follow the disease as it attacks one person after
another in a community and study the epidemiologic picture, drawn
no longer with the individual as a unit, but with the community as the
unit.</p>

<p class='c007'>We must here distinguish between a primary epidemic, the first
wave of a progressing pandemic, and the secondary type in which may
be grouped those large or small recurrences which light up for a period
of one to three or more years after the primary wave.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Primary type of epidemic.</i>—One of the first important statistical
studies on this subject was that of P. Friedrich who charted the
influenza morbidity in Munich between the months of December,
1889, and February, 1890. Similar observations have been made by
Parsons, Raats, Linroth, and H. Schmid, following the 1889 epidemic.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between the occurrence of the first known case of influenza and the
time of the first very definite increase in influenza incidence in a
community, which interval may be termed the invasion period, there is
as a rule two weeks. During this period, of course, more and more
cases are occurring, but remain usually sufficiently isolated to attract
no public notice. From this point the epidemic develops very rapidly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>and reaches its peak, usually within two or at most three weeks. In
another two or three weeks the incidence has fallen away nearly to
normal. The epidemic period comprises from four to six weeks, or,
including the invasion period, an entire duration of six to eight weeks.
This is the picture produced in a community by a primary uncomplicated
epidemic of influenza. Greenwood well describes the salient
features of a primary epidemic as “first a rapid and quasi-symmetrical
evolution, and second, a frequency closely concentrated around the
maximum.” In other words the duration is short, the rise to a peak
rapid, and the subsequent fall equally rapid. He showed that in the
July and August, 1918 epidemic in Great Britain nearly 80 per cent. of
the total incidence in the localities studied was grouped within three
weeks time. His curve corresponds so well with that of the Munich
epidemic that he is able to superimpose them (Chart I). The rapid
rise to a peak, almost explosive in character, more characteristic of
this disease than of any other, is to be explained by the high degree
of invasiveness of the organism, by the short period of incubation,
by the fact that many of the sick continue at their work, thus spreading
the disease, and by the non-immunity of large masses of people,
together with the fact that the transmission of a respiratory infection
is accomplished much more easily than is any other type of infection.</p>

<p class='c007'>The author holds that the infrequency of immunity is a most
important factor in the production of this type of outbreak. The
mode of transmission of influenza is the same as that of other respiratory
diseases. The infectivity is probably no greater than that of
measles, although that indeed is relatively great. The means of transmission
are presumably the same in each. Were we able to develop an
immunity for influenza of as high degree and permanence as we possess
against measles, pandemics of influenza would disappear. We wish
to emphasize that the primary type of curve is a phenomenon not
peculiar to influenza, but that under certain circumstances it may
be found in other infectious diseases, and that it would be found more
frequently in the other diseases if the immunity developed against
them was of as short duration as it appears to be against influenza.
If, for example, measles were to break out in a large group of individuals,
none of whom had had the disease, the type of curve would be
the same. We will produce evidence supporting our theory under
another subject. Of course, other factors such as short incubation
period and unusual opportunities for spread through mildly ill individuals
play a not unimportant role.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span><i>Secondary type of epidemic.</i>—There is a decided difference between
the curve of a primary wave as it appears in the onward rush of a new
pandemic and that of a secondary wave occurring at a greater or less
interval following the primary spread. A secondary epidemic affects,
according to Greenwood, a relatively small proportion of the population,
is slower in reaching its maximum, and thereafter declines slowly
and irregularly, more slowly than it increases. The distribution of
the curve is less symmetrical and there is less concentration around the
maximum. A secondary epidemic may be characterized by a much
higher fatality than a primary one.</p>

<p class='c007'>We believe that the configuration of a secondary type of wave is due
chiefly although not entirely to a certain degree of residual immunity
in a large number of individuals remaining from the first spread.
There is a striking similarity between Chart I and Chart XXVIII,
the latter showing the measles incidence in epidemics among rural or
chiefly non-immune troops in the United States army. Chart XXIX
shows a similar epidemic among urban or chiefly immune individuals.
Here the curves correspond more to those of a secondary type of
influenza epidemic. Thus we see that, in the absence of immunity,
other infectious diseases may produce the primary type of curve, and
that this curve is not a feature of influenza alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>A striking difference between the two types of waves of influenza
is the uniformity and relative constancy of the primary type as contrasted
to the great variation in the secondary type. The story of
the first spread of influenza in one community is usually similar to that
of its spread in any other community. Certain exceptions will be
alluded to later. But in the case of recurrent epidemics we may find
them more severe or much milder; we may find that they attack a
large number of individuals or a very few; we may even find an entire
absence of recurrent epidemics in certain communities. The primary
curves are relatively uniform; the secondary curves are variable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between 1889 and 1894 in England there were four epidemics.
The first was primary, symmetrical, and lasted between December
and February, 1889–90. The second was asymmetrical and much more
fatal in the localities studied by Greenwood. It occurred in the spring
and summer of 1891. There was a third epidemic in the autumn and
winter of 1891–92 and a fourth occurred from November, 1893 to
January, 1894. The third epidemic, according to Greenwood, showed
some tendency to revert to the primary type in respect to symmetry,
while the fatality rate partook of the character of a secondary epidemic.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>Creighton writes: “That which chiefly distinguishes the influenza
of the end of the nineteenth century from all other invasions of the
disease is the revival of the epidemic in three successive seasons, the
first recurrence having been more fatal than the original outbreak,
and the second recurrence more fatal (in London at least) than the first.
The closest scrutiny of the old records, including the series of weekly
bills of mortality issued by the parish clerks of London for nearly two
hundred years, discovers no such recurrences of influenza on the great
scale in successive seasons.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Greenwood, who has studied this subject in great detail in England,
discusses Creighton’s remarks as follows: “He would be a bold man
who challenged the accuracy of Creighton upon a point of historical
scholarship, and I have only to suggest that there are faint indications
of increased mortality in years following primary epidemics of influenza
prior to the nineteenth century. Thus 1675 was a year of primary
epidemic influenza, fully described in Sydenham’s Observationes
Medicae.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The nature of the succeeding constitutions is not clear, but the
deaths ‘within the bills’ for 1676 were considerably more numerous
than in 1675, although smallpox, fever and ‘griping of the guts’ were
noticeably less fatal.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the English Responsoria (1, 54) the epidemic constitution of
1679 is described as a recurrence of that of 1675—that is, as having the
features of primary epidemic influenza. In the five following years
intermittents prevailed, and in one (1684) the mortality much exceeded
that of 1679, although the deaths from smallpox were fewer. Again,
a hundred years later, in 1782, there was a famous summer epidemic
of influenza in London which gave rise to much discussion. The
London mortalities in 1782 and 1783 were, however, almost equal, when
the smallpox deaths (which were nearly three times as numerous in
1783 as in 1782) are subtracted from the total mortality of each year.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whether these vague indications are sufficient to permit of our
thinking that the epidemic constitution of 1889–94 was not entirely
unprecedented is disputable. But the contrast of the latter period
with the preceding single epidemic of 1847–48 is striking; that was a
primary epidemic without important sequelae.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We have now to consider whether our experience this year is
concordant with that of the early nineties, a reversion to the earlier
type, or a new phenomenon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After comparing the 1889 curves with those for the July, 1918,
outbreak in England, Greenwood concludes: “I believe that the evidence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>just presented establishes a substantial identity between the
summer outbreak of 1918 and the primary wave of 1889–90. We do
not need to appeal to any new factor arising out of the war to account
for it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I next consider the secondary epidemic which we are now experiencing
(October, 1918). Evidently our knowledge of the events in
1891 would lead us to feel no surprise at the emergence of a secondary
wave, although we could not be sure that the precedent of 1847
would not be followed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The summer epidemic of 1918 in the Royal Air Force included
nearly 80 per cent. of the total incidence within the three weeks containing
the maximum, and the Munich epidemic included just over 80
per cent. within the same limits. Now if the current epidemic has
reached its maximum, not more than 65 per cent. of the incidence will
probably be so concentrated, and the duration will therefore be longer
than in the summer; if, as suggested by the ratio of the last two ordinates,
the maximum is not yet attained, then the quota of the three
first weeks is likely to be still smaller and the complete duration still
longer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The diagram of factory sickness leads to the same inference, which
is that, from the standpoint of prevalence, the present is a typical
secondary epidemic, congruent with that of 1891.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It appears, then, that the origin of the summer epidemic must be
explained upon such epidemiological principles as will account for the
primary wave of 1889–90, that the current outbreak is in pari materia
with that of 1891, its excessive mortality being mainly due to the
accident of season, aided by the special circumstances of overcrowding
and fuel shortage which are due to the war. In a word, this is not
essentially a war epidemic.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Wutzdorff found that in some towns, particularly in North Germany,
the 1891–1892 wave was almost as extensive as that of 1889–90
had been in other places, but that in general the morbidity in Germany
was much lower. He bases these conclusions on a study of the extent
of crowding in the hospitals in the two years, on statistics of government
physicians, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Europe the recurrent epidemics of 1891 increased as a rule very
gradually, developed slowly, reached their high point frequently
after many weeks, and as gradually decreased. The epidemic duration
in the winter of 1891–92 lasted four or five months. The morbidity
in spite of the longer duration was decidedly less. This is very different
from the explosive appearance of 1889 when the peak was reached
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>in fourteen days and the whole epidemic had been completed in six to
eight weeks. There were some exceptions to this rule, as in Yorkshire,
England, where the epidemic broke out suddenly between the 11th
and 13th of April, 1891, had reached its peak after ten days, and for
another twenty days declined. Especially interesting was Sheffield,
where the first spread began gradually and ran a slow course, while the
second epidemic of 1891 began explosively, lasted a short time and
declined rapidly, but showed a significantly greater mortality than
that of 1889.</p>

<p class='c007'>The experiences in various communities in the United States have
been not unlike those described for European cities. Abbott in
describing the successive epidemics in Massachusetts remarked that
the 1889–90 spread manifested itself by a sudden rise in the mortality
from influenza and pneumonia, beginning about December 20th and
culminating in the middle week of January, thereafter falling off quite
suddenly in February to about the usual rate for these diseases. The
second epidemic two years later began with a more gradual rise in
October and November and then increased sharply in December,
continued for nearly three weeks at its maximum in January, and
declined nearly as sharply as in the previous epidemic two years
before.</p>

<p class='c007'>Winslow and Rogers who have studied the 1918 epidemic as it
affected the various towns of Connecticut observed that the outbreak
in a given community generally occupied a period of from six to eight
weeks, and was steep and abrupt in communities which were badly
hit, flatter and more gently sloping in those which escaped lightly.
Also the outbreak was more severe in communities receiving the
infection early than in those later affected.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Mortality curves.</i>—Pearl has studied the epidemic constitution of
influenza in forty-two of the large cities of the United States. He has
plotted the annual death rate per 1,000 population from all causes in
each week, from the week ended July 6, 1918, up to January 1, 1919,
and observed a very distinct difference in the type of curve for deaths
from all causes during the epidemic period in the various cities. These
differences have been chiefly in respect to the severity and suddenness
with which they were attacked. Thus Albany, Boston, Baltimore,
Dayton and Philadelphia show an initial explosive outbreak of great
force, while Atlanta, Indianapolis, Grand Rapids, Milwaukee and
Minneapolis exhibit a much slower and milder increase of the mortality
rate. In Albany and Baltimore the curve of the first epidemic outbreak
rises to a peak and declines at about the same rate. In Cleveland
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>and St. Paul, on the other hand, the rate of ascent to the peak
is very rapid, while the decline is slow and long drawn out.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of the cities, such as Albany, show but a single well defined
peak in the mortality curve. Others, such as Boston, New Orleans
and San Francisco show two peaks; while still others, like Louisville,
show three well marked peaks.</p>

<p class='c007'>Usually the first was the highest and the second and third were
progressively lower. Milwaukee and St. Louis, on the other hand,
showed second peaks higher than the first. The usual phenomenon,
however, was a large first wave followed by smaller ones.</p>

<p class='c007'>The highest, or maximum peak rate of mortality during the
epidemic varied greatly, from 31.6 per 1,000 in the case of Grand
Rapids, to 158.3 per 1,000 in the case of Philadelphia.</p>

<p class='c007'>The death rates which were of the most frequent occurrence were,
generally speaking, rates below 70 per 1,000 per week.</p>

<p class='c007'>The date of the week in which the maximum peak rate occurred was
earliest in Boston and Cambridge, where it occurred October 5th,
and latest in Grand Rapids, Milwaukee and St. Louis (December
14th). Thirty-one of the 40 cities studied had attained the peak rate
of mortality prior to November 2d. In the case of Milwaukee and
St. Louis the maximum peak was the second peak, whereas in
Grand Rapids it was the first peak that was so late. Sixty-five
per cent. of the 40 cities showed two distinct peaks in the mortality
curve, while 15 per cent. had one peak, and 8 or 20 per cent. had three
peaks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It appears clearly that there was a definite tendency for the two-peak
cities to fall into two groups in respect of the time elapsing
between first and second peaks. About a third of them had the second
mortality peak around eight weeks after the first peak. The remaining
two-thirds had the second peak, on the average, about thirteen
weeks after the first. The three-peak curves had the second peak on
an average 7.1 ± 0.3 weeks after the first, and the third peak on an
average 13.1 ± 0.3 weeks after the second. The cycle in the epidemic
waves would therefore appear to be nearly a multiple of seven weeks
rather than the ten weeks tentatively deduced from the dates of peaks.
There the process of averaging obscured the true relations.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Duration of explosive outbreak.</i>—The range of the duration of the
first outbreak of epidemic mortality is great, varying from five weeks
in Richmond, Virginia, to twenty-three weeks in Atlanta, Georgia.
Twenty of the cities, one-half the total number, showed a duration of
ten weeks or less, while in the other half the duration was eleven weeks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>or more. The mean duration of epidemic mortality in the first  outbreak
was 11.90 ± 0.55 weeks. The ascending limb of mortality rate
was rapid in nearly all cities. The descending limb was usually
slower. In 34 of the 40 cities it required four weeks or less time for the
mortality rate to pass from normal to its epidemic peak. But in only
half as many (17) of the cities did the rate come down from its peak to
normal again in a period of four weeks or less. The mean time from
normal mortality rate to peak was 3.90 ± 0.21 weeks. The mean time
from peak mortality rate to normal was 8.00 ± 0.50 weeks. Thus it
took about twice as many weeks for the mortality curve to come back
from its peak to normal, as were required for the increase from normal
to peak at the beginning of the explosion. This is on the average.
The ascending limb occupied about a month and the descending limb
two months.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pearl’s curves which have been copied in this report (Charts II to
VII) enable us to follow his conclusions. Pearl offers a partial explanation
for the variations in the different cities. There can be no doubt
but what many factors play a role in the causation of these variations,
and it is to be regretted that up to the present no statistics for smaller,
more homogeneous communities have as yet been reported which
could be compared with Pearl’s excellent work on the large cities of
the country. Were his work supplemented by records from smaller
towns in which the varying factors are less numerous, in which there is
less occupational variation, additional conclusions could probably be
reached. The unfortunate feature is that as a rule statistics from the
smaller cities and towns are less reliable.</p>

<p class='c007'>From a detailed mathematical study of influenza in 39 of our largest
cities, done chiefly by the means of multiple correlation, with the hope
of being able to explain the differences in the epidemic curves of weekly
mortality in the various cities, Pearl concludes as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The general conclusion to which we come from an examination of
the correlation data assembled to this point is that these four general
demographic factors, density of population, geographical position, age
distribution of population, and rate of recent growth in population, have
practically nothing to do, either severally or collectively, with bringing
about those differences between the several cities in respect to explosiveness
of the outbreak of epidemic mortality in which we are interested.
Significantly causal or differentiating factors must be sought
elsewhere.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Concerning geographical position, he did find some slight relationship
with linear distance from the city of Boston, where the epidemic
was supposed first to have begun in this country:</p>

<p class='c007'>“This result means that the greater the linear distance of a city
from Boston the less explosive did the outbreak of epidemic mortality
in that city tend to be. This is in accord with the general epidemiological
rule that the force of an epidemic tends to diminish as it spreads
from its primary or initial focus. It must be noted, however, that
the correlation coefficient in this case is not large. It is barely past
the value where it may safely be regarded as statistically significant.
This fact may probably be taken to mean that influenza does not follow
the epidemiological law referred to with anything like such precision
as do some other epidemic diseases, notably poliomyelitis.”</p>

<p class='c007'>These factors having been found to be of little value in his attempt
to explain the varying curves in the 39 different cities, Pearl next
correlated the explosiveness of the epidemic mortality with deaths from
all causes, deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis, from organic heart
disease, from acute nephritis and Bright’s disease, from influenza, from
pneumonia (all forms), from typhoid fever, from cancer and from
measles, in the various cities.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The outstanding fact which strikes one at once from this table is
the high order of the correlation which exists between the explosiveness
of the outbreak of epidemic mortality in these communities and the
normal death rate from certain causes of death in the same communities.
In the first four lines of the table the correlation coefficients
range from about 6 to more than 10 times the probable errors. There
can be no question as to the statistical significance of coefficients of
such magnitude.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The highest correlation coefficient of all is that on the first line
of the table, for the correlation of epidemicity index with death rate
from all causes. The existence of this high correlation at once indicates
that an essential factor in determining the degree of explosiveness
of the outbreak of epidemic influenza in a particular city was the
normal mortality conditions prevailing in that city. In the group of
communities here dealt with, those cities which had a relatively high
normal death rate had also a relatively severe and explosive mortality
from the influenza epidemic. Similarly, cities which normally have a
low death rate had a relatively low, and not sharply explosive, increase
in mortality during the epidemic.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It will also be noted that the correlation in the next three lines
of the table, namely those of pulmonary tuberculosis, so-called, organic
diseases of the heart, and chronic nephritis and Bright’s disease, are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>of the same order of magnitude as that between the death rate from
all causes and the explosiveness of the epidemic outbreak of influenza.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Pearl suggests that this correlation might arise because of differences
in the constitution of populations in the different cities, or,
that it was a factor of geographical position, such as the distance from
the Atlantic seaboard; but that even after correction of the results for
age distribution and geographical position, the net correlations were
actually higher than were the gross uncorrected correlations.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We may conclude that the most significant factor yet discovered
in causing the observed wide variation amongst these 39 American
cities in respect of the explosiveness of the outbreak of epidemic influenza
mortality in the autumn of 1918 was the relative normal
liability of the inhabitants of the several cities to die of one or another
of the three great causes of death which primarily result from a functional
breakdown of one of the three fundamental organ systems of
the animal body, the lungs, the heart and the kidneys.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Winslow and Rogers studied the relation of the pneumonia death
rate from 1901 to 1916 to the influenza death rate of 1918 in 40 large
cities of the United States and found a distinct correlation. The
cities which have been characterized by a high pneumonia rate in the
past are precisely the cities which suffered most severally in the 1918
outbreak. This is not due especially to virulent types of pneumonia
organisms in certain sections of the country because they found this
same high correlation between total death rates and influenza death
rates, in the same cities.</p>

<p class='c007'>They believe that these high correlations may be the result of
weaknesses in the population due to high incidences of organic diseases
and tuberculosis in earlier years, or more probably that the correlation
is an indirect one, due to the relation between each of the factors
studied and one or more underlying conditions affecting both, such as
age distribution of the population, race distribution, or social and
economic conditions in the various cities studied. Or, finally, it
may be that the high rate from tuberculosis and organic disease in
1916 was due to these latter factors, while the high incidence of influenza
was due chiefly to proximity to the original focus of infection.
None of these explanations are considered entirely satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is important to call attention to the fact that the American
observers quoted have been studying the death rate from influenza
as it is revealed in the increase of death rate from all causes, whereas
Leichtenstern and Wutzdorff, and Greenwood, in his studies in the
Royal Air Force have concerned themselves with <i>morbidity</i>. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>comparison of morbidity and mortality cannot be easily made as we
will show when discussing these two subjects, so we cannot conclude
that the work of Pearl and of Winslow and Rogers is at variance with
the other work quoted. The mortality curves form another characteristic
of the local spread of influenza in a community.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is characteristic of influenza that the curve of deaths does not
fall as rapidly as does the curve for influenza cases. Thus in morbidity
curves we may expect to find a symmetrical curve for a primary
epidemic, but the mortality is rarely if ever symmetrical, the curve
rising rapidly and falling very much more slowly.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Morbidity curves in 1920 recurrences.</i>—The curves of influenza
incidence in the recurrence of 1920 have varied in different localities,
but in certain communities where the record has been carefully
reported the epidemic appears to be characterized by a symmetrical
evolution and usually a lower death rate as compared with 1918.
The curve of incidence in the State of Massachusetts in January,
February and March, 1920, is symmetrical, if anything falling away
more rapidly than it ascends, and the duration is at least ten weeks.
The crest of the influenza wave in Massachusetts was reached on
February 4th, 5th and 6th. The peak is recorded as being in the week
of February 7th.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the 1920 epidemic the author made a house-to-house canvass
in six representative districts in the city of Boston covering a population
of 10,000 individuals. The curve of incidence of influenza corresponds
closely with the curves for the city and the state as a whole.
The peak was reached in the same week, the week ending February
7th, the curve was symmetrical, and the duration of the entire epidemic
was about the same. The morbidity rate for 1920, according to our
influenza census, was but half of that for 1918 for the same population.
The recurrent epidemic as we will show later was decidedly milder
(see Chart XVIII).</p>

<p class='c007'>In Detroit the 1920 epidemic reached its peak for morbidity on the
9th day, and that for mortality on the 16th. In 1918 the morbidity
peak was not attained until the 15th day and the death peak on the
22d. The recurrent outbreak had nearly run its course within three
weeks. The following comparison between the influenza incidence in
1918 and 1920 in Detroit is taken from a report by H. F. Vaughan,
Commissioner of Health for that city. In it is shown a comparison
of the total figures on the twenty-seventh day of each of the two
epidemics:</p>

<p class='c007'>There had been fewer cases reported on the twenty-seventh day of
the 1920 epidemic, but these had resulted in a greater number of
deaths. On this day the recurrent epidemic had run its course, while
the 1918 one was still in full swing. On the twenty-seventh day of
1918 there were 137 influenza cases reported and 49 deaths. On this
day in 1920 there were but 24 cases and 34 deaths. Thus the second
outbreak was of shorter duration, but was more deadly while it lasted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Seven weeks of the 1920 epidemic in Detroit killed 0.20 per cent.
of the population, two out of every one thousand people. A similar
period at the beginning of the epidemic of 1918 witnessed the death
of 0.17 per cent. of the population. This was a smaller number, but
the epidemic at this time had not completed its course, and continued
to be more or less prevalent for twenty-one weeks, resulting finally
in the death of 0.28 per cent. of the population. The recurrent epidemic
was more highly fatal, but, being of shorter duration, Detroit
actually suffered less from it.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Spread in Countries and Continents.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>The spread of influenza is usually not limited to a single community.
Almost invariably it will travel on to another locality, carried thither
by human intercourse, and will there build again a local epidemiologic
picture more or less modified by changes in the environment and
changes in the virulence of the virus itself.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Spread, in primary waves.</i>—Reference to the table of epidemics in
history will show that in many of the epidemics and in most of the
widespread epidemics and pandemics there appears to have been a
definite, clearcut, direction of spread from one locality to others. In
the recent literature there has appeared considerable discussion
concerning the site of origin, the endemic focus of pandemic influenza.
Briefly the question raised is as to whether there are single or multiple
foci. We will for the time ignore this perplexing question. In either
case, after the influenza virus has once attained such communicability
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>as to produce a pandemic it does follow a direct course over countries
and continents. This may be followed in resumé in our table.</p>

<p class='c007'>The disease does not at any time spread more rapidly than the
available speed of human communication between the areas affected.
If influenza does appear simultaneously in two widely separated
communities without having been brought there from a common source
it must be that it arose spontaneously from simultaneous increase in
virulence of the virus in those localities.</p>

<p class='c007'>Influenza was prevalent in Turkestan, Western Asia, in May of
1889. It spread first to Tomsk in Siberia and did not appear in
Petrograd until the end of October. By the middle of November it
had reached Berlin and Paris, and one month later it was epidemic in
New York and Boston. Four months had been required for the
disease to reach Petrograd from Bokhara in Turkestan, while within
two months thereafter it had traveled from Russia to the United States.
In both cases the rapidity of spread corresponded to the rapidity of
the means of communication of the locality; the caravan in Turkestan
and the transatlantic liner to America. North America was widely
infected in January of 1890. So, also, Honolulu, Mexico, Hong Kong,
Japan. Ceylon first experienced the epidemic early in February,
India at the end of the month, Borneo and Australia on the first of
March, Mandalay towards the first of May, China and Iceland in
July, Central Africa in August and Abyssinia in November of 1890.</p>

<p class='c007'>It should be noted that influenza was reported to have been prevalent
in Greenland at about the same time that it was in Bokhara.
There appears to have been no relationship between these two outbreaks.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spread of the pandemic may be followed also by recording the
period of greatest mortality in the various cities. This period at
Stockholm followed that at Petrograd by three weeks, and that of
Berlin by another week. The period for Paris was a week later than
for Berlin, that for London another week later, and that for Dublin
three weeks later than that for London. The week of highest mortality
in Dublin was later than that for New York or Boston.</p>

<p class='c007'>The earlier epidemics progressed more slowly. That of 1762 prevailed
in Germany in February, in London in April, in France in July,
and in America in October. In 1782 it attacked London in May,
Exeter two weeks later and Edinburgh early in June. In 1830–1832
the spread from Moscow and Petrograd through Germany required no
less than eight months to cover the latter country.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1872 the time required for spread from Leipzig to Amsterdam
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>was eighteen days, the same time that was required for a merchant in
the latter town to reach Leipzig.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are many instances on record in which influenza has passed
by small towns in its onward course to attack a larger city and only
at some later date has the small town, not on the main line of communication,
been affected. Not only is the speed of transportation
between two communities of importance, but also the volume of the
transportation undoubtedly plays a part in the rapidity of development
in a second locality. When the disease is carried by a vessel the
first places to be attacked are the seaports and the coast towns, be the
land a continent or an island. From there it spreads inland either
rapidly or slowly according to the transportation facilities. Formerly
the question was raised whether influenza spread in continuous lines
or radiated in circles. Naturally it follows the direct lines of communication,
most of which are radially distributed around large
centers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Leichtenstern calls attention to the fact that in the 1898 epidemic,
as in the previous one, the general direction of spread was from East to
West across Europe. This was also true of the epidemics of 1729,
1732, 1742, 1781, 1788, 1799, 1833, and 1889.</p>

<p class='c007'>There have been in Europe two general routes followed by pandemics,
a Northern one through Russia and following the lines of travel
into Germany and through the countries of Europe; and a Southern
path coming from Asia, through Constantinople, and entering Europe
from the South, particularly Italy. With the latter, after reaching
Europe, the spread is northerly; with the former it is southerly, and
usually Spain was the country last infected.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the United States as well, pandemic influenza usually has spread
from East to West, entering the country at or near New York or
Boston, and spreading West and South. This was true in the autumn
epidemic of 1918.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Spread in recurrences.</i>—As a rule the manner of spread of a secondary
epidemic following the primary pandemic wave is quite different.
At a longer or shorter interval following the first spread the disease
breaks out anew in one locality or another, sometimes simultaneously
in widely separated districts. Sometimes we can distinguish a direction
of spread in the relatively small community affected, it frequently
being observed that the disease will start up in a large city which has
experienced the illness during the first pandemic, and from there will
spread to small nearby localities which may have remained free until
that time. Again, any clearcut direction of spread may be entirely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>lacking. It is rare indeed that an epidemic following another by a
short interval will follow a definite line over an entire country or
continent. Such an example is, however, to be found in the epidemic
of 1833, which traveled over Europe from Russia, spreading to the
west and the south and following practically the identical path that
it had taken in 1830. Even so it was not as widespread, for while the
epidemic of 1830 had covered the entire earth, America appears to
have escaped the second epidemic.</p>

<p class='c007'>These disseminated and independent outbreaks are believed to arise
from endemic foci in which the virus has been deposited during the
progress of its first spread and in which the germ has survived until
it has acquired once again exalted virulence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Usually these endemic outbreaks show in their local configuration, a
secondary type of wave. That this is not always the case we have
already indicated. The epidemic of 1732–1733 was a recurrence of
that of 1729–1730. The epidemic of 1782 had as its source the epidemic
of the years 1780–1781. The epidemic of 1788 recurred until
1800, and was quite possibly associated with those of 1802, 1803 and
1805–1806. That of 1830 recurred in 1831–1832. Next we have in
1833 the true pandemic originating in Russia. Recurrences of the
epidemic of 1836–1837 were found in 1838 and in 1841. Those spreads
which occurred in 1847 and 1848 found successors in the year 1851.
In 1890 the influenza outbreaks were as a rule single or isolated and
occurred in only a few places of Europe, particularly in Lisbon, Nürnberg,
Paris, Copenhagen, Edinburgh, Riga, London, etc. It is reported
that there was an unusually severe local outbreak in Japan in
August, 1890. In 1891 no general direction of spread was manifested,
yet in heavily populated areas, or states rich in lines of communication,
especially those of Europe and North America, one could frequently
trace some definite direction followed by the disease within these
relatively small territories.</p>

<p class='c007'>A. Netter made the following observation at that time: “<span lang="fr">La Grippe
a fait des explosions simultanées ou successives, et on n’a pu en aucune
façon subordonner ces différents foyers comme cela avait été possible en
1889–90. Il parait y avoir eu des reveils de l’épidémie sur divers
points.</span>”</p>

<p class='c007'>Leichtenstern describes the subsequent spread of the disease:
“The transfer of the disease by ships which played such an important
role in the first epidemic appeared to be insignificant in 1891, in spite
of the fact that influenza was present in many of the English colonies.
The third real epidemic spread of influenza was a true pandemic which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>began in the autumn (October) of 1891 and lasted through the whole
winter until the spring of 1892. It involved all of Europe and North
America and spread to all other lands, but here again the geographic
distribution followed no rule. There was no spread of influenza from
a central point, no continuous spread following lines of communication,
and there was no longer an early predominance in the cities lying
on the lines of communication or in the larger cities and commercial
centers, as had been the case in the first epidemic. In England in
1891 the first outbreaks occurred frequently in country districts. The
epidemic raged nearly four months in the northern part before it
finally reached London in May. The same was true of Australia.</p>

<p class='c007'>“One peculiarity of the recurrent epidemic lay in the much more
contagious character of the disease and the remarkably greater mortality.
In Sheffield the mortality in the recurrent epidemic was greater
than in the pandemic, even though the epidemic picture was that of a
primary wave.”</p>

<p class='c007'>By way of summary of our knowledge of the primary and secondary
spread in general up to the epidemic of 1918, we may enumerate the
more important characteristics:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Occurrence of true pandemics at wide intervals, primarily
intervals of several decades.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Indefinite knowledge and conflicting evidence regarding site
and manner of origin.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Apparent transmission chiefly or entirely through human
intercourse.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Rapid spread over all countries, the rapidity roughly paralleling
the speed of human travel.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. Rapid evolution of the disease in the communities where outbreaks
occur, with nearly equally rapid subsidence after several weeks’
duration.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. Apparent lack of dependance on differences of wind or weather,
seasons or climate.</p>

<p class='c007'>7. Generally low mortality in contrast to enormous morbidity.
Variation in the incidence of disastrous secondary infections.</p>

<p class='c007'>8. Tendency to successive recurrences at short intervals.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Influenza Epidemics Since 1893.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>In this section of our report we will describe with as great accuracy
as our sources of information will permit, and in as great detail as
space will allow the events which have led up to the epidemics of
1918–20 and the various phases of the epidemics themselves. Points
of similarity with previous epidemics will be made obvious; the differences,
when of significance, will be described and studied in detail.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Occurrence Since 1893.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>Attempts even today to determine when and where influenza has
prevailed in the world since the great pandemic of the last century are
met with great difficulties. There are several reasons for this, chief
among which is the absence of definite characteristics by which the
disease may be recognized. The isolated solitary case baffles positive
diagnosis. Nearly every year there are reports in the literature of
small outbreaks in institutions or communities in which the clinical
picture is that of epidemic influenza. As a rule the conclusion has
been in these cases that because the bacteriologic findings did not show
a predominance of Pfeiffer’s bacillus the epidemic was not true influenza.
This is particularly true in the outbreaks in which the streptococcus
predominated. Today our views concerning the bacteriology
have changed distinctly, and I believe it is safe to say that the predominance
of a streptococcus in a local epidemic in no way rules out influenza,
and that the only criteria by which we may judge are the clinical
picture and the evidence of high infectivity, together with the epidemiologic
characteristics of the local outbreak.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Period 1893–1918.</i>—A review of the medical literature between 1889
and 1918 gives one a certain impression which may be summarized as
follows: Between 1890 and 1900 the disease was in general more
highly prevalent in most localities than at any time during the preceding
thirty years. At no time during this decade did the annual death
rate from influenza in England and Wales fall to anywhere near the
figures that had prevailed consistently between 1860 and 1889. Between
1900 and 1915 there was a gradual diminution, but still not to
the extent that had prevailed previous to 1889. Since 1915 there
appears to have been a gradual increase. During the entire period
there has been difficulty in distinguishing between the disease in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>question and other respiratory tract infections, particularly coryza,
sore throat, tonsillitis, and bronchitis. Many of the local epidemics
which appear probably to have been true influenza have had associated
with them a high incidence of sore throats. We describe this as
sore throat, rather than tonsillitis, because the clinician remarks that
although the throat is sore there is little if any demonstrable inflammation
of the tonsils.</p>

<p class='c007'>Chart VIII published by Sir Arthur Newsholme, showing the
death rate per million of population from influenza in England and
Wales gives some idea of the prevalence of the disease in the first part
of the interpandemic period in those countries. It should be remarked
that the record is for deaths from influenza only.</p>

<p class='c007'>For records in this country it is convenient to refer to the death
rate in the State of Massachusetts; first, because the records in that
State have been carefully kept for a long period; and second, because
influenza has been carefully studied in this State during both epidemics
by two most competent epidemiologists. For the period preceding
1889 we quote herewith from Abbott:</p>

<p class='c007'>“For the past 45 years or more, or during the period of registration
which began with the year 1842, no epidemic of influenza has
prevailed within the State to such an extent as to have manifested
itself in any serious manner in the annual lists of deaths. An examination
of the registration reports for each year since 1842 shows that
in no year were recorded more than 100 deaths from this cause; the
highest number from influenza in a single year (92) occurred in 1857,
and the least number (8) in 1884. The average annual number of
deaths from this cause reported in the State for the period 1842 to 1888
was 38. The average number during the first half of this period was
greater than that of the last half, especially when considered with
reference to the increase of population. From these statistics of nonepidemic
influenza between the years 1842 and 1888 it appears that its
greatest prevalence, or rather the years in which the mortality from
this cause was greatest, were also years of unusual mortality from
pneumonia, and in some instances from bronchitis.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frost has charted the death rate per 100,000 from influenza and
from all forms of pneumonia in Massachusetts by month, from 1887
to 1916. From it he concludes that the epidemic of 1889–1892
developed in three distinct phases, the first culminating in January,
1890, the second in April and May, 1891, and the third in January,
1892. The mortality was higher in 1891 than in 1890, and still higher
in 1892, while in 1893, although there was no distinct epidemic, the
pneumonia mortality for the year was even higher than that of 1892.
Frost remarks that this corresponds to the experience in England,
and that it apparently represents the general experience in other
countries (see charts IX and X).</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>In the absence of comparable statistics for Massachusetts in 1917
and 1918, Frost has studied for those years certain other localities,
particularly Cleveland, San Francisco and New York City. The
mortality in all of these places, as well as in Massachusetts, was fairly
regular from 1910 to 1915, but in December of the latter year and
January of 1916 there occurred in New York and Cleveland a sudden
sharp rise in mortality. This was not shown distinctly in the San
Francisco curve, but it was a rise which was almost universal and
synchronous over the entire registration area. It is of interest as
indicating the operation of some definite and widespread factor, and
suggesting in this group of diseases an epidemic tendency which is
perhaps, as Frost remarks, not sufficiently appreciated. In January
of 1916 he found that influenza was reported to be epidemic in twenty-two
states, including all sections of the country. The epidemic was
very mild. In the early spring of 1918 there was another sharp rise,
which we shall discuss in greater detail later.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Increase in 1900–1901.</i>—Reference to Frost’s chart for Massachusetts
shows that there was also a rise in the curve around 1900. At
this time influenza was quite widely disseminated. Early in 1901 the
Marine Hospital Service made a canvass of all the states and several
foreign countries to determine the epidemic prevalence of influenza.
The results of the canvass were published in the Public Health Reports.
The records lack the detail, particularly in the description of clinical
symptoms, that is desirable in arriving at an identification, but the
universal agreement from all individuals reporting, in the comparatively
high morbidity and remarkably low mortality, together
with the widespread distribution, and the duration of the local epidemic
leaves little doubt as to the identity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Influenza was reported present in October of 1900 in Los Angeles,
Milwaukee and New Orleans. In November it became prevalent in
Toledo and Cincinnati and in New York City. In December the
disease was present in Chicago, Albany, Philadelphia, San Francisco,
Denver, Baltimore, Grand Rapids, Columbus, O., Portland, Me.,
Detroit, Albuquerque and Omaha. In January it was reported in
New Haven, Boston, Washington, D. C., Indianapolis, Louisville,
Ky., Wilmington, Del., Portland, Ore., and Juneau, Alaska.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although the disease was mild, in some localities a high proportion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>of the population was attacked. Thus in New Haven it was estimated
that 10 per cent. developed the disease, and in Los Angeles 20 per cent.,
while in Wilmington, 40,000 were estimated to have become ill. In
certain small towns in Texas the incidence was especially high. In
Pittsburgh, Texas, ten per cent.; Laredo, 15 to 20 per cent.; Hearne,
50 per cent.; and El Paso, 50 per cent. were attacked. The duration
of the epidemic in most localities was from four to six weeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus we see that in October, November and December of 1900 and
January of 1901 there was a widespread epidemic affecting all parts of
the United States. Many additional records in the Public Health
Reports coming from small towns have not been included in this
summary.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the same time an attempt was made to determine the prevalence
in foreign countries and letters were sent to the various United States
Consulates. It was discovered that the disease was mildly epidemic
in Denmark in October, in Berlin in November, in Cuba, British
Columbia, Ontario, Egypt, Paris, Mexico and the West Indies in
December; in Flanders, Porto Rico, Honolulu, in January of 1901; in
Malta in February, 1901; and in London and Ireland in March of that
year. The following countries reported that they had no influenza
at the time: Windward Islands, Jamaica, Bahamas, Brazil, India,
Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Persia, Philippine Islands,
Spain, Switzerland. The disease was reported as being not of epidemic
prevalence in the following localities: Marseilles, Paris, Bremen,
Hamburg, Mainz, Stuttgart, Bristol, London, Liverpool, England as
a whole, Scotland, Amsterdam, Naples, Constantinople.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reports from Switzerland and from Brazil stated that there had
been no influenza since the pandemic period 1889–1893. The death
rate per 100,000 in Glasgow from influenza for 1896 was recorded as
six; for 1897, twelve; for 1898, fifteen; 1899, twenty-two and for 1900,
twenty-seven.</p>

<p class='c007'>The disease was present in Lima, Peru in March, 1900, and at Malta
in the same month. In Prague it was stated that ten per cent. of the
population had been attacked in the winter of 1901. In Sivas, Turkey,
fifty per cent. of a population of 50,000 were estimated to have been
taken ill within the winter months. It was reported from Valencia,
Spain, that there had been four or five visitations of influenza since
the preceding pandemic, each recurring invasion presenting a milder
and less expansive form than its predecessor. Very few deaths had
been recorded as directly due to influenza, but an increased mortality
followed the epidemics. In normal times the average mortality was
ninety deaths per week. After a visitation of influenza the number
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>had increased to as much as 160 per week. The population numbered
204,000.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Period from 1901 to 1915.</i>—Between 1900, with its wide distribution
of a very mild influenza, and 1915, there is very little mention of
epidemic prevalence of the disease. References which appeared in the
Public Health Reports during the interval are characterized chiefly
by their brevity, and by the absence of descriptive detail. They
should nevertheless be included.</p>

<p class='c007'>In October of 1901 there was some increase of the disease in the
Hawaiian Islands, 110 cases being reported on the island of Kauai.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the same time, C. Williams Bailey reported a mild form of
influenza existing in Georgetown, S. C., which was first considered to
be hay fever in consideration of the presence of the rice harvest season,
but which was finally decided, after careful investigation, to be true
influenza.</p>

<p class='c007'>On July 21, 1902, the U. S. Consul at Canton, China, telegraphed
that influenza “was almost epidemic, plague sporadic in Canton.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1903 the disease was reported as apparently prevalent at New
Laredo, Texas.</p>

<p class='c007'>Surgeon Gassaway, of the Marine Hospital Service, reported from
Missouri, December 14, 1903, as follows: “There is a very decided
increase in the number of cases of influenza in this vicinity. Two
have been admitted within the last few days to this hospital, and
several cases have appeared among the patients under treatment.
In these cases the onset is sudden and the disease appears principally,
at least at first, to be confined to the nose and throat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Measles and influenza were reported prevalent in Barbados, West
Indies, during the month of December, 1904.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sturrock describes a quite typical local epidemic in a British
institution in 1905.</p>

<p class='c007'>Influenza was epidemic in Guayaquil and various other places in
Ecuador during the months of June and July, 1906.</p>

<p class='c007'>Selter speaks of a true local epidemic of a disease clinically resembling
influenza which occurred in 1908 and extended over the territory
from France to the Rhine.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hudeshagen mentions having examined bacteriologically cases of
influenza in the year 1914.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ustvedt relates his experience at the Ullevaal Hospital up to
September, 1918. Since 1890 there had been cases reported every
year from the high marks of 10,461 cases in Christiania in 1890 and
5,728 in 1901 to the lowest figure, 138 in 1906. “The cases listed as
influenza in the last few years may have been merely a catarrhal fever.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>This is the more probable as the cases were restricted to the winter
months, while influenza usually occurs at other seasons.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Jundell believes that influenza is endemic at Stockholm, Sweden,
hundreds of cases being reported there each year. During the years
1912–1919 Pfeiffer’s bacillus has been found in ten per cent. of those
cases in which the diagnosis seemed certain.</p>

<p class='c007'>A current comment in the Journal of the American Medical
Association in 1912 remarks that epidemics of coryza, sore throat,
and bronchitis usually have been called influenza or grip because of the
characteristic contagiousness and the infectivity, the persistence of
the symptoms, and the tendency to prostration and mental depression.
But this diagnosis has not been satisfactorily confirmed by bacteriologists.
An epidemic according to the Journal, which occurred in
Boston and which was called sore throat, was studied by Richardson
and others. They traced the contagion to a streptococcus which
apparently was spread by means of milk. Müller and Seligman had
recently carried out a study of an influenza epidemic among children
in Berlin and concluded that the causative organism was a streptococcus,
differing so much from the ordinary germ that they used the
term “grip streptococcus.” Davis and Rosenau, according to the
comment, had made a bacteriologic study of a recent epidemic of sore
throat in Chicago, and had demonstrated as the exciting agent a
streptococcus of peculiar characteristics, which in many respects
resembled the organism described by Müller and Seligman. The
Journal noted that these three epidemics occurring during the years
1911 and 1912 in widely separated communities were all caused by the
streptococcus, and cautioned against the proneness to call all such
epidemics grip. Today the predominance of the streptococcus would
not necessarily rule out influenza in our minds.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the winter of 1913, C. L. Sherman had occasion to study carefully
fourteen cases of so-called influenza in the vicinity of Luverne,
Minnesota. Bacteriologic smears and cultures were made from the
throat and sputum in all cases. Bacillus influenzae was found in
two of the fourteen; pneumococcus in four and streptococcus in all.
Tubercle bacilli were found in one case. The onset of the disease was
invariably abrupt. The fever in all cases ranged between 101° and
104°; symptoms indicative of infection of the upper respiratory tract
were always present. There was more or less sore throat in all.
There was either cough at the onset or else it appeared within 48
hours. Headache was complained of by twelve of the fourteen; pains
in the back and in the limbs by thirteen, and nervous symptoms by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>six. Prostration out of all proportion to the fever and other symptoms
prevailed. Two developed an otitis media and the streptococcus was
isolated from the purulent discharge in both cases. One patient had a
complicating empyema, and one an acute arthritis. Sherman also
concluded that we are prone to call too diverse diseases influenza.</p>

<p class='c007'>Walb stated in 1913 that at Bonn during the preceding years there
had been numbers of cases of a febrile affection which seemed to
be typical influenza, but for which the pneumococcus appeared to be
responsible. They were never able to isolate the influenza bacillus,
and according to their statement the Hygienic Institute at Bonn, as
well as that at Berlin, had not “encountered an influenza bacillus
within the preceding ten years.”</p>

<p class='c007'>C. T. Mayer described in 1913 a case of influenza in Buenos Ayres
which is of particular interest in view of one of the symptoms, cyanosis,
which was so prominent a feature in 1918. This appears to have been
an isolated case. The diagnosis wavered between miliary tuberculosis
and pneumonic plague, because of the high fever and intense cyanosis,
with nothing to explain the cyanosis on the part of the heart. There
were signs of severe congestion of both lungs, and notable enlargement
of the spleen. Bacteriologic examination was negative except
for the presence of Bacillus influenzae and Micrococcus catarrhalis.
The patient subsequently improved rapidly, and the lungs were
entirely normal after thirty days, thus ruling out the other two
diseases.</p>

<p class='c007'>A London letter to the Journal of the American Medical Association
dated February 5, 1915, runs as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Since the outbreak of the war the public health has been remarkably
good, but the record is now being threatened in the case of
London, at any rate, by an epidemic of influenza.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The gastric symptoms which distinguished last year’s epidemic
are absent. The disease is most infectious. Whenever it has seized
the individual it has usually run through the entire household.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whole offices have succumbed, and as the mildness of the attack
lures the sufferer to continue his normal occupation, the disease has a
full opportunity of extending. A large number have resulted in
pleuro-pneumonia; otherwise the chief symptoms are headache, fever,
tonsillitis.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Telling and Hann describe another clinical diagnosis of influenza,
the diagnosis being concurred in by Sir James Goodhart and Sir
Clifford Allbutt. The onset was absolutely sudden at a supper party
on November 10, 1912. The patient had a slight rigor, and was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>compelled to go to bed. In the night he had a longer and more
severe rigor, with a temperature of 103°. On the following morning
he dressed, but another chill sent him back to bed with a temperature
still 103°, pulse 110, regular, and remarkably dicrotic. There was no
cough and no sore throat. Another chill occurred in the evening.
On November 12th the patient had two chills, the temperature remaining
steadily at 103° to 104°. The patient complained much of nausea
but did not vomit. On November 13th the temperature remained
up, there was no chill on this day; the spleen was large and easily felt
for the first time. On the 14th note was made that there was no
headache. On the 15th, 16th and 17th the temperature began to
fluctuate. On the 18th there were two severe rigors, and by the 19th
the temperature suddenly fell to normal, with drenching sweat.
Throughout there was nothing to suggest pneumonia, and typhoid
fever appears to have been successfully ruled out.</p>

<p class='c007'>An epidemic of influenza which prevailed in the city of Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, from December to February of 1907 and 1908, has been
described by J. A. Lichty. He says that the epidemic was as widespread,
though probably not quite as severe, as the pandemic of
1889. Whole families, including servants and all associated with
the household, were afflicted in rapid succession. The onset was
sudden and severe, the usual symptoms of pain, all over, being most
pronounced. The temperature did not go unusually high, nor did it
seem to be in accord with the severity of the symptoms when the
patient took to his bed. In typical cases the attack lasted from two to
three or four days. Peculiar to this epidemic seemed to be the general
complaint of sore throat. Upon examination the throat rarely showed
any other evidence of an abnormal condition than a rather dark
cyanotic blush, which was most intense over the tonsils and faded out
over the roof of the mouth. This was rarely associated with any
swelling or fever. Sinusitis and otitis media seem to have been the
two most frequent complications. The disease appeared to be
particularly fatal for chronic invalids. It was highly contagious.
Many of those physicians who were frequently exposed to the disease
fell victims.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the same time C. H. Jones described an epidemic of the same disease
in Baltimore. The symptoms were described as headache,
backache, limb-ache, with a slight elevation of temperature, seldom
more than 102°. Catarrhal symptoms developed secondarily and
were not so prominent a feature as in former epidemics. There were
some gastric symptoms, usually consisting of vomiting and nausea.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Jones quotes no statistics, but feels sure that the infection was more
extensive than at any period since 1895.</p>

<p class='c007'>Coakley and Dench describe throat and ear complications as they
saw them in New York. From this we may assume that the disease
was present at the same time in New York City.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following chart, derived from the U. S. Vital Statistics Report
shows the increase in the death rates from influenza in 1900 and 1901;
that of 1907 and 1908, and finally an increase to 26.4 per 100,000 in
1916, which reflects the epidemic beginning in the latter part of 1915:</p>

<p class='c007'>At best our information for these years is unsatisfactory. It is
greatly to be desired that individuals who have access not only to the
current medical literature, but also to the vital statistics and other
records for all countries possessing reliable records, and who are
versed in the newer mathematical methods of demography, establish
definitely the influenza prevalence and distribution during these interpandemic
years. The difficulty in this work is that mortality statistics
are unreliable and morbidity statistics are lacking.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Influenza in 1915–1916.</i>—Until the end of 1915 there was no widespread
distribution in the United States similar to that of 1900 and
1901, but at that time there developed a widespread epidemic in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>country of similar or possibly slightly greater severity than that of
fifteen years previously. Reference to the last table will show that
during 1916 the annual death rate from influenza as reported in the
United States Vital Statistics reached the rate of 26.4 per 100,000.
According to V. C. Vaughan the literature of that time shows that this
epidemic originated in the West, first attracting attention at Denver,
and gradually spread over the country.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Dublin of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company gives the
following table in which the deaths from influenza and pneumonia
during the months of December, 1914, and January, 1915, are compared
with deaths from the same cause during the months of December,
1915, and January, 1916:</p>

<p class='c007'>Coffey and others have reported an epidemic of influenza at Worcester,
Mass. during the first three weeks of January, 1916. During the
first three weeks of January, 1915, there were reported in that city
twenty-two deaths from respiratory diseases, making a total of 14.9
per cent. of the total deaths. In the same period of 1916 there were
reported ninety-three deaths from acute respiratory diseases in the
same population.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Two of the more complete descriptions of the epidemic of the year
1915–16 are those by Mathers, and by Capps and Moody. Mathers
reports that: “During the winter of 1915–1916 the United States
was visited by a severe epidemic of acute respiratory infections which
resembled in every detail the great epidemic of 1890. This outbreak
was apparently first noticed in the Middle Western States, and it
spread rapidly over the entire country, taking a heavy toll of human
life. December and January were the months in which these infections
were most prevalent, and the epidemic had almost completely lost its
impetus by March, 1916. During the height of this epidemic in
Chicago, sixty-one cases of the disease were studied bacteriologically,
and the results form the basis of this paper.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mathers found hemolytic streptococci in forty-six instances, in all
of which they predominated. Green producing streptococci were
found thirty times, with one pure culture, and pneumococci thirty
times with four pure cultures. Staphylococci were isolated in fifty
cases; Micrococcus catarrhalis in six, and Friedländer’s bacillus in one
case. The influenza bacillus was found in only one instance, and then
in small numbers. The majority of the patients were studied early
in the course of the disease, and in the earliest, hemolytic streptococci
were almost constantly found, especially in the throat. In the atypical
pneumonia which followed many of the attacks of grip, hemolytic
streptococci predominated. In none of these was the Bacillus influenza
found.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mathers reported that coincident with the epidemic among
humans there was an epizootic of so-called influenza among horses.
The symptoms are very similar to that of the disease among humans.
He isolated a streptococcus as the predominating organism in the
horses. The streptococci from human and equine sources, although
similar in many characteristics, differed widely in pathogenicity, and
seemed to be highly parasitic for the specific hosts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Capps and Moody found that in man most cases began rather
abruptly, with coryza, pharyngitis, laryngitis, or bronchitis.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The chief complications were inflammation of the accessory sinuses
of the head, and bronchopneumonia, the latter being responsible
for most of the fatalities. None of these symptoms taken alone would
justify the distinctive name of grip. But the widespread and almost
simultaneous onset of this fairly uniform symptom group and the
rapid cessation of the epidemic after a few weeks reminded physicians
generally of the great grip pandemic of 1889–1890. This resemblance
was further strengthened by the unusual prostration lasting days or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>weeks after even mild attacks. The older practitioners can recall no
similar epidemic during the twenty-five years intervening between
1890 and this year. The numerous epidemics of septic sore throat
have all been entirely different in their symptomatology, and all were
restricted to certain localities. The term “grip,” therefore, seems
justified from a clinical standpoint.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The public health reports offer evidence of an unusual prevalence
of pneumonia in the larger cities. Nicolas calls attention to the fact
that the incidence of grip was greatest in those cities in which the
mortality from pneumonia was most strikingly increased.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Capps and Moody found that as a rule the white blood counts
in the individuals sick with influenza were 10,000 or less. A number
showed true leucopenia. Less frequently there was a leucocytosis
up to 15,000 or higher.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Influenza between 1916 and 1918.</i>—Zinsser cites Dr. George Draper,
who believes that he observed at Fort Riley in the winter of 1917
epidemic cases of influenza. He believes that for Europe too there is
evidence that influenza was endemic during the years preceding the
great outbreak, and that a number of minor epidemic explosions had
occurred in the years just preceding 1918:</p>

<p class='c007'>“MacNeal who has investigated military reports particularly, states
that small epidemics occurred in the British Army in 1916 and 1917. A
chart constructed by him from the American Expeditionary Force
reports shows that a considerable rise in reported influenza cases took
place in November and December, 1917, and in January, 1918, gradually
declining toward spring. MacNeal, compiling the data available in
the office of the Chief Surgeon, A. E. F., states that the influenza
morbidity reported per 100,000 for succeeding months in 1917, were as
follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Robertson, who studied many of the secondary pneumonias
which came to autopsy at this time found an unusual type of lobular
pneumonia in which Pfeiffer bacilli were frequently found. In many
of these cases the organisms could be obtained from the nasal sinuses
and antra. Similar findings were reported by British bacteriologists
(Hammond, Rolland and Shore, and Abrahams, Hallows, Eyre and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>French), who studied the cases that occurred in the reports by Austrian
physicians in reference to outbreaks of typical influenza on the Austro-Russian
front early in 1917.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There seems little doubt, therefore, that for some years before
the pandemic of 1918 influenza was endemic in many parts both of
Europe and of America. As early as 1915–1916 Frost finds evidences
of limited epidemic outbreaks in the United States. During the
winter immediately preceding the true beginning of the pandemic
small outbreaks occurred among the allied troops in France, the
British troops in England and probably among American troops
gathered in home concentration camps as well. MacNeal in a summary
of the conditions prevailing among American troops in France
concludes that epidemic influenza in that country originated from
the endemic foci there existing, and that the disease was probably
carried from Europe to the United States by shipping. The former
assumption; namely, that the epidemic occurrence of the disease may
have been due to the fact that an enormous and concentrated newly
introduced material of susceptibles may have been lighted into flame
at the numerous endemic smoulders, may well be correct. The latter,
however, concerning the transportation of the disease from Europe to
America may justly be questioned. For, in the first place, Frost’s
studies have shown that prepandemic outbreaks were quite as frequent
in the United States as in Europe during 1915 and 1916, and, though
we have no proof of this, there is reason to believe that influenza was
prevalent in concentration camps during 1917.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Carnwath, after remarking that the epidemic began in the British
Army in France in April, 1918, says that according to the reports of
the Influenza Committee of the Advisory Board this was not the first
time that Pfeiffer’s bacillus had appeared in the armies. On the
contrary, it had frequently been found in cases of bronchopneumonia,
especially during the winter of 1916–1917. It is doubtful, however,
whether much importance, from the epidemiologic point of view,
attaches to these sporadic findings of the Pfeiffer bacillus.</p>

<p class='c007'>Influenza was reported in the year 1917, but this year, as well as
the epidemic of 1916, becomes involved in a determination of the date
of onset of the great pandemic of 1918.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>The Pandemic of 1918.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>The date and site of onset of the great pandemic are subjects concerning
which there is no conclusive information. There have been
small outbreaks of clinical influenza with epidemic tendencies at one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>place or another during nearly all of the intervening years since 1889.
In all of them the question is open as to whether they were true influenza,
and also assuming that some were true influenza, how many of
them should be so included. There are some who believe that the
increase of morbidity following the measles epidemic in the United
States Army camps in the winter of 1917–18 is genetically associated
with the great pandemic. In short, there is no one point in the last
few years at which we may say that influenza which had previously
been non-existent started at a focus and spread throughout the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>It follows from the experience of 1889 that we should at least
attempt to find an endemic focus and to follow the progression of the
disease. It is safe to say that once having become pandemic the
disease spread as it did thirty years previously. Experience in this
country, where the autumn spread began in the New England States
and continued West and South; knowledge of the late spread to remote
localities; the fact that the disease first appeared in England, etc. in
sea coast towns; the introduction of the influenza into new countries at
seaport towns, after the arrival of infected ships, all coincide well with
the past history.</p>

<p class='c007'>But which of the several local epidemics of the preceding years was
the direct progenitor of the great pandemic? In order to follow more
clearly the development of the facts we will record here the various
hypotheses that will come up for consideration as to the site of origin
of the disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Influenza is endemic in some one locality, such as Turkestan
in Asia, from which place the disease spreads throughout the earth
at intervals, after having acquired in some way greatly increased
virulence. The local outbreaks of interepidemic times are not due to
the virus which causes the great pandemics and should be called
pseudo-influenza in contrast to influenza vera. Following the pandemic
it is true, however, that for a succession of years local outbreaks
occur, due to the pandemic virus which has been left deposited in small
endemic foci. These disappear in the course of a few years.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The second hypothesis is similar to the first, except that in
it is considered the possibility of there being more than one endemic
focus, at least two, one in the old world and one in the new. Although
Leichtenstern believed in the first hypothesis he did not deny the
possibility of the second.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There have been in the past several well described influenza
epidemics limited to North America. Furthermore true pandemics
have occurred at the same time in North America and in Europe. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>can suggest the hypothesis that there is a permanent endemic focus,
just as in central Asia and Russia, existing in the southern part of
North America. The following facts concerning the last pandemic
period favor this idea.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As early as May, 1889, influenza began in Athabasca (British
North America) and in the summer of 1889, in Greenland. It is
especially interesting to hear of an extensive influenza epidemic which
in the middle or toward the end of December, 1889, broke out in the
Northwest Territory of British North America, in Manitoba, in the
Island of Vancouver, similar to that in the east of Canada and Quebec.
A spread of the epidemic, which attacked Boston and New York on
December 17th, to the above territories, far away and connected by
very poor transportation facilities, is certainly improbable, especially
in consideration of the time at which the two epidemics occurred.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are told that the invasion and the outbreak of influenza in
these vast territories occurred at practically the same time at such
widely separated places as Fort MacLeod, Saskatchewan, Prince
Albert and other military posts, and furthermore in isolated Indian
camps and tribes between which there was little or no communication.</p>

<p class='c007'>“These facts also indicate that we are considering primary endemic
pandemics analogous to the one which broke out in July, 1889, in
Central Asia.”</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The virus of influenza is more or less uniformly distributed
throughout the world. We may say that it is endemic in many
localities, as is the case with the meningococcus. Quite frequently
in one locality or another the virus acquires increased virulence and
causes a small local epidemic which may even spread to adjoining
territories. It is possible that the virus in two or more separated
localities may become more invasive simultaneously, thus causing
widely separated and unrelated outbreaks. As a rule the virulence
does not become so great as to cause a true pandemic, but at rare
intervals, usually of decades, or thereabouts, the epidemic virus
becomes so greatly enhanced, perhaps from passage to new territory
and through non-immune individuals, that it eventually commences
on its wild career around the earth. Perhaps the <i>pandemic</i> variety
usually comes from one particular locality among the many endemic
spots. Perhaps always from the same locality or perhaps at times
even simultaneously from many different ones. It is possible even
that an increased virulence develops simultaneously in all localities.
This third hypothesis develops into a discussion as to whether the
small interpandemic epidemics are true influenza or some other disease.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>Again, Leichtenstern, although he does not favor it, recognizes the
possibility of this theory:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whether the small local epidemics reported by Kormann in
Coburg in 1878 and by O. Seifert in Würzburg in 1883 are the same as
the true epidemic influenza is at present uncertain. Some of the
complications, such as swelling of the neck glands, and especially
frequently parotitis, purpura, scurvy, indicate that the epidemic in
Russia, in 1856–1858, reported by Kasin, was not the true influenza.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When W. Zülzer writes in 1886 of an epidemic in Berlin in which
many thousands of individuals were attacked, the question might
arise, is this the same influenza which three years later passed through
the entire world and which in Berlin was believed by the same physicians
to be a new disease?</p>

<p class='c007'>“The evidence is better in the case of the epidemic reported by
von den Velden in 1874–75. First, because of the complication with
pneumonia and especially because at the same time the disease sprang
up in several places in France, South Germany and the Rhine Provinces.
It is very doubtful whether epidemics described in 1855 and
1862 in Iceland, in 1870 in Philadelphia, in 1875 in Scotland, in 1876
in the Fiji Islands, in 1887 in several places of England, in October,
1889 in Natal, in November, 1889 in Jamaica and Prince Edward
Island, was the true influenza, even though the complications of
pneumonia in the last named epidemics favor this assumption. As
regards the influenza epidemic which attacked specially the school
children of Pleshey and Great-Waltham and from which fifty per cent.
became ill in November and December, 1889, whereas the pandemic
was known to have begun there in January, 1890—the high percentage
of school children that were attacked renders the conclusion that this
was influenza very doubtful.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is an entirely different matter concerning the last epidemic
in which the epidemiologic compilations, based on retrospective
diagnoses suggest that in many places of Germany the ‘first case’ of
even small epidemic outbreaks was observed as early as the summer
and autumn of 1889; in other words, several months before the outbreak
of the true pandemic in December.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Leichtenstern believed that the so-called catarrhal fever and
epidemics of “cold” which some have been accustomed to call grip or
influenza are not the true disease, although he admits that there is no
pathognomonic sign by which the diseases may be differentiated. He
expected that search for the influenza bacillus which had recently
been discovered would enable investigators to determine by its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>presence or absence whether or not these local epidemics are true
influenza.</p>

<p class='c007'>This, of course, would depend on the proof that the influenza
bacillus is the cause of the disease. If the many local influenza outbreaks
which Hirsch has collected in his exhaustive historical tables
are the same disease as true influenza, then the picture of influenza
must be considered as rather protean. Leichtenstern adds that this is
a possibility which from present information we cannot deny. He
writes: “If such is the case we must give the following epidemiological
definition of influenza: Influenza is a specific, infectious disease usually
occurring epidemically which, however, is endemic over the entire
earth, as indicated by outbreaks of cases, and which, after years and
decades have passed, breaks out in epidemic proportions. It is
recognized nearly every year in one or another place on the earth
where it becomes epidemic. From time to time from some point or
center, or from several points, as for instance simultaneously in the
old and new world, and for reasons unknown to us, an enormous
increase in virulence of the specific virus occurs and with it a great
increase in the contagiousness of the disease. Those are the times
when influenza spreads in mighty epidemics over wide stretches of
land and portions of the earth, or over the whole earth. Our common
epidemic influenza or grip, occurring practically isolated or in very
small outbreaks, belongs to the same type of disease as the pandemic
variety, but is due to a mitigated form of the causative organism, one
of decreased virulence and of shorter viability.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>Provisionally, however, we will hold</i> until the proof has been
obtained by bacteriological methods that influenza nostras and influenza
pandemica are two entirely different diseases, just as are cholera
nostras and asiatica. Accordingly, we will divide the diseases
designated as influenza in the following way:</p>

<p class='c007'>“1. Influenza vera, caused by the Pfeiffer bacillus.</p>

<p class='c007'>“2. The endemic-epidemic influenza vera which arises from the
germ remaining after the spread of the influenza pandemic and which
is caused by the same germ, the bacillus of Pfeiffer. The duration of
this endemic state of influenza vera may last years in single localities.</p>

<p class='c007'>“3. The endemic influenza nostras, or pseudo-influenza or catarrhal
fever, commonly called grip, a disease sui generis. The germs
causing this disease are at present as little known as are those of
cholera nostras.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Parkes, in 1876, recognized these possibilities: “The exact spot
has not been made out. Two opinions prevail. First, one focus;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>second, many foci. Each nation, in turn, attributes the disease to its
neighbor and from the names so given one can follow the direction of
the epidemic.” Noah Webster believed that in 1698, 1757, 1761 and
1781 it originated first in America. Hirsch believed that some of
the epidemics had probably originated in North America.</p>

<p class='c007'>We find then that after the pandemic of the last century the same
epidemiologic questions had arisen that have come into such prominence
during the present period. As a rule those who have quoted the
epidemiologists of 1890 to 1900 have mentioned the first hypothesis
and have failed to allude to the fact that the other two were considered.
So we see that the subject was by no means settled even at
that time, and that if we should discover that the 1918 pandemic
cannot be traced to a single endemic focus our results will not be
absolutely contradictory to those of the last century.</p>

<p class='c007'>Returning to a consideration of the period 1916–1918, we observe
from reference to Frost’s diagram that in the spring of 1918 there was
a sharp and general rise in mortality from influenza and pneumonia.
Frost reports that in the larger cities on the Atlantic seaboard this
increase occurred generally during January, February and March,
when pneumonia mortality normally reaches its maximum. The
increase was not so evident in all these cities as it was in New York
City. In the rest of the country, especially in the Central and Western
States, the increase occurred in April, a month during which pneumonia
mortality is generally on the decline, and was sufficient to
constitute an unmistakable departure from the normal. The increased
mortality rate extended quite generally into May and in some areas
still longer. This is the first increase after 1916 that is pictured in the
mortality statistics for the country at large.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are some who believe that they saw influenza in mild form
in the United States army in the year 1917. V. C. Vaughan has
investigated this possibility and from a study of the sick and wounded
charts decided that there was no relation between influenza and the
pneumonia which was prevalent in 1917, and which usually was
secondary to measles, being caused by the streptococcus in the majority
of localities. The lack of association between influenza and
pneumonia in 1917 and the direct association in 1918 is well brought
out by a comparison of the figures in the two following charts, prepared
by V. C. Vaughan:</p>

<p class='c007'>Stallybrass, who has studied the influenza and pneumonia deaths
in Liverpool, England, since the 1889 pandemic, states that in every
year there had been reflected in the curves evidence of periodic
increase in deaths from influenza and pneumonia, and he states that
from 1914 onward there has been a progressive increase in the annual
number of influenzal deaths with the single exception of 1917.</p>

<p class='c007'>It becomes evident that we cannot with the information at hand
find any one locality in which the disease was prevalent sufficiently
ahead of the pandemic and to the exclusion of other localities, so
that we might determine accurately the site of origin. The next step
will be, then, to discover as accurately as possible the date at which
various communities were first definitely attacked by the great
pandemic, and to search out the locality first affected.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Date of First Increased Prevalence in Various Localities.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>From table II which gives the earliest recorded dates of increased
prevalence in different localities, we can gain a fairly accurate idea as
to the direction and manner of spread of the disease during the pandemic.
Influenza was first noticed in the United States early in
March, 1918. By the end of the month it had become more disseminated
in very mild form over many of the States east of the
Mississippi and a few West of that line. The following month the
disease appeared in France. In the American Expeditionary Forces
in France it first appeared at the base ports which were receiving
troops from the United States. During this month the disease had
reached the allied Western front, the German front had become
infected and probably the disease had started on its travel inward into
enemy country. In May the disease was reported present in Scotland,
Spain, Greece and Egypt. In June England became infected, as also
Switzerland, Germany, Austria and Norway. In this month the
disease had reached as far as South America and India. In China, on
the 15th of June, there was reported an epidemic of a disease resembling
dengue which affected fifty per cent. of the population in Chefoo
and Shanghai. This disease may well have been influenza. During
July the disease had spread through Germany, appearing according to
German reports in the cities toward the West earlier than in Berlin
and other more Eastern cities, including Vienna. In July the disease
was present in other countries of Europe and was again reported in
China and India.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>During its course through Europe influenza had developed a
greatly heightened virulence and toward the end of August it again
appeared in the United States apparently traveling in a reverse
direction from that of its first spread and, entering the country at
Boston, it spread to the West and South until the entire country
was covered. The West Indies were invaded early in August and in
the same month the disease had spread through India as far as the
Punjab. In September the epidemic continued through the West
Indies, attacked Mexico and Canada, and had attained such remote
localities as the South Africa Union, Senegal and Korea. In October
the spread was particularly distributed through South America, and
in this month again remote localities such as Alaska, New Zealand,
the Hawaiian Islands, Australia, and Madagascar were reached.
Islands, which although not very remote, were isolated except for the
arrival of occasional ships, such as Cuba, the Azores and the Canary
Islands, were first reported attacked in October. In November the
spread continued throughout the world, and among the more remote
localities should be mentioned Samoa, Arabia, Iceland. In December,
Lapland, the Society Islands and the Fiji Islands were invaded (see
Chart XI).</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>It is particularly of interest to follow the spread of the disease
in Europe. Perhaps the chief characteristic is the distribution equally
to the north and south of France, a country which appears to have
been invaded early. In May it spread to Scotland and to Spain,
Greece and Egypt. In June the spread was in three directions, to
England and Norway on the North, to Switzerland, Germany and
Austria on the East, and again into Spain and Italy on the South.</p>

<p class='c007'>The correctness of the foregoing description of the spread of
influenza depends first, upon the accuracy of the authorities quoted,
and particularly upon our having discovered the earliest report for
each country. The author believes that the information as obtained
for the United States represents nearly the true state of affairs, and
that the error present is negligible. The information obtained for
France is based upon the statements of excellent investigators, Netter,
Chauffard and Massary, for the French population, and MacNeal,
Zinsser and Longcope, for the American Expeditionary Forces. Here
the statements agree both for the military and for the civil population
that there was no widespread influenza in France much before April
1st. Also, the author feels that the information for England and
Scotland is authoritative and will not later be changed. It is based
particularly upon the excellent reports by Carnwath, who has investigated
the subject in great detail. The excerpts from the German
literature, although not abundant, are practically unanimous in
agreeing as to the date of invasion in Germany. The reports from
the remaining countries of Europe have been less abundant, and
frequently the author has been forced to rely upon a report by only
one individual; but while the date may be in error, yet the month of
occurrence is probably correct.</p>

<p class='c007'>For other continents, Asia, Africa and South America, the reports
as far as they go appear reliable, but it is impossible to prove that at an
earlier date there was not a very mild epidemic in some one of these
localities, similar to the earlier epidemic in the United States, which
escaped detection. It is particularly important, in view of the 1889
experience, that we obtain if possible fuller information on the earliest
time of the appearance of the disease in China and other parts of
Asia, and that we determine whether there was a spread from that
continent to America previous to March, 1918.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several factors have added considerably to the difficulty in tracing
the site of origin of the 1918 epidemic and its direction of spread. The
principal of these have been the speed of modern travel, the character
of modern commerce, and the existence of a state of war. The
channels of the commerce of today radiate nearly from all points to all
other points of the civilized world. No longer are there a few preeminent
lanes of travel, such as there were in 1580 when the epidemic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>spread clearly from Constantinople to Venice and on to Hungary and
Germany, finally finding its way to Norway, Sweden, Denmark and
Russia. The war has made it difficult to know accurately the date
and direction of spread in enemy countries. We have practically no
information, except that in the public press, from Russia and the Balkan
States. By October of 1918 the severe form of the disease had
become prevalent in every continent, and by December it had reached
the farthest islands of the Southern Pacific ocean.</p>

<p class='c007'>The apparent difference in the direction of spread between 1889 and
1918 makes comparison of rapidity difficult. But if we take as our
starting point the time at which each epidemic became prevalent in
commercial centers of Europe and the time at which it finally reached
localities well off the usual paths of commerce we will see that there is
some difference, the disease spreading more rapidly in the recent
epidemic, but that the difference is no greater than could be accounted
for by the more modern means of communication. From April, 1918,
when the disease appeared in France, to October, when it was reported
in Madagascar, is six months. From October, 1889, with the disease
prevailing in Petrograd, to July, 1890, when it appeared in Madagascar,
is nine months. It required seven months after the disease
became epidemic in France this time for it to appear in Iceland, and
nine months in 1889–90.</p>

<p class='c007'>The earliest recorded epidemic of influenza in the United States in
the spring of 1918 (but which was not recognized to be such until
later) appears to have been that at Camp Funston, described by
Opie and his associates as having appeared in that Camp March 5th.
The epidemic swept quickly throughout the Camp and spent itself
as rapidly. A second wave appeared in April and in May a third, both
of which were almost entirely limited to newly drafted men brought into
camp subsequent to the preceding outbreaks. Correlated with each
of these three outbreaks was a period of increased incidence of pneumonia
and bronchitis, frequently occurring in influenza cases. These
complicating diseases were prevalent in the organizations attacked by
the influenza and maintained the same relation to the length of service
of the men affected.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next report of influenza in the United States was from the
Oglethorpe camps, beginning about March, 18, 1918. Within two
weeks every organization in Camp Forrest and the Reserve Officers
Training Camp was affected. After about three weeks the epidemic
subsided rapidly. Fourteen hundred and sixty-eight cases were sent
to the hospital out of a total strength of 28,586. It is estimated that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>2,900 cases had occurred. The clinical symptomatology and the
epidemic characteristics were described in detail.</p>

<p class='c007'>On March 28th the author had occasion to observe a similar
epidemic at Camp Sevier, South Carolina, which appears to have
attacked a smaller proportion of the troops in camp, but which showed
the same epidemiologic picture. A note in the Public Health Reports
states that on March 30, 1918, the occurrence of eighteen cases of
influenza, of severe type, from which three deaths resulted, was
reported at Haskell, Kansas. This is the earliest report we have been
able to find concerning the disease in civil communities. That for
Chicago was practically contemporary. The Commissioner of Health
of Chicago states in his special report on the autumn epidemic, that in
March, 1918, distinct epidemics resembling influenza were observed
in certain portions of that city.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Public Health Reports, fevers of an undetermined
nature were reported during April and May at various points from
Norfolk to Louisiana. “An examination of the records and reports of
the physicians who had treated these cases leads to the belief that these
fevers were mainly influenza of mild type.” It is possible, however,
that all cases reported were not of the same disease, and in one locality
in Louisiana dengue may have occurred.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fleisher states that during the latter part of March and early
part of April, 1918, there occurred at Camp Wadsworth an epidemic of
measles and practically concomitant with it an epidemic form of
bronchopneumonia associated with empyema. During this time
there were some 200 cases of measles and twenty-one cases of bronchopneumonia
or empyema in which a hemolytic streptococcus was the
causative agent. He makes no mention of any epidemic of influenza
either in mild or severe form, occurring at this period.</p>

<p class='c007'>Forbes and Snyder reported that during the month of April, 1918,
a highly contagious, but comparatively mild infection of the respiratory
tract was epidemic in Camp Hancock. Several thousand men
in the command were infected, but relatively few were ill enough to
be sent to the hospital. The only fatal case occurred early in the
epidemic, and it was the observations made in this case which prompted
the study made by Forbes and Snyder.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fatal case had the subjective symptoms familiar to influenza.
The physical findings were similar to those occurring in influenza in the
later epidemics. The leucocyte count was 4,300. A blood culture
showed in twenty-four hours a heavy growth of small non-motile,
gram-negative bacilli which the authors concluded to be Bacillus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>influenzae. The leucocyte counts made at five hour intervals on a
later date were respectively, 3,400, 2,200 and 2,300. A second blood
culture taken on April 10th, a day later, also showed a pure culture of
the same organism. The leucocyte count had risen to 5,600. At
necropsy a confluent bronchopneumonia was found. There was no
pleural effusion and the other viscera showed nothing remarkable.
Bacillus influenzae was recovered from cultures taken from the lung
and spleen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Throughout this epidemic the clinical picture of the disease was
characteristic. Nearly every patient gave as the initial symptoms
backache, headache, slight cough or sore throat. Conjunctivitis and
a marked injection of the soft palate were noted in ninety per cent. of
the cases. In addition, a slight or moderate general adenopathy was
often observed. The face was flushed and in a few cases the skin of
the thorax presented a mild erythema. In three cases a provisional
diagnosis of scarlet fever was made until the blood count showed a
leucopenia. Leucopenia was characteristic of all cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the early April epidemic at this camp, nasopharyngeal
cultures showed an organism resembling Bacillus influenzae in seventeen
out of thirty-three cases, but the identity of the organism was not
established by subcultures. In ten cases in which sputum examinations
were made, Bacillus influenzae was found in only four; streptococci
were present in six. Blood cultures on twenty consecutive
non-fatal cases, only one of which was complicated by bronchopneumonia,
were all negative.</p>

<p class='c007'>V. C. Vaughan reports that at Camp Shelby, Hattiesburg, Miss.,
there was in April a division of troops numbering about 26,000. An
epidemic of mild influenza struck this camp in April, 1918, and within
ten days there were about 2,000 cases. This included not only those
who were sent to the hospitals, but also those who were cared for in
barracks. This was the only division that remained in this country
without change of station from April until the fall of 1918. During
the summer this camp received 20,000 recruits. In October, 1918,
the virulent form of influenza reached this camp. It confined itself
almost exclusively to the recruits of the summer, and scarcely touched
the men who had lived through the epidemic of April. Not only the
2,000 who had the disease in April, but the 24,000 who apparently
were not affected, escaped the fall epidemic.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vaughan also remarks that in March and April of 1918 there was an
unusually high death rate from pneumonia in Atlanta, Ga., Kansas
City, Mo., Detroit, Mich., and Columbus, Ohio, while in the autumn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>epidemic these cities suffered rather less than the average. In view of
the experience at Camp Shelby he reasons that there was probably
mild influenza in these cities in March and April of 1918. It may be
stated that in the mortality statistics for 1918, the abnormally high
death rates for respiratory diseases during March and April were
present throughout the registration area of the United States.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first reports that we have been able to discover concerning
influenza on the Pacific Coast are for the month of April. Stanley
reports three successive waves of epidemic influenza at San Quentin
Prison, Cal. The first began on April 30, 1918, with the entrance into
the institution of a prisoner who was sick on admission.</p>

<p class='c007'>Following the disease in its possible spread to the next continent we
are inclined to conclude that it was carried to France with the great
body of men traveling to that country from the United States. MacNeal
and Longcope both report that in the first outbreak in the American
Expeditionary Forces the earliest recorded epidemic appeared
about April 1, 1918, in a rest camp near Bordeaux. It reached its
height April 22d and ceased May 5th. According to V. C. Vaughan
a mild epidemic of influenza and pneumonia prevailed at Brest and
in that vicinity from April 1st to July 31st, 1918. During this time
fifty cases of influenza, twenty-six of which developed pneumonia,
with two deaths were admitted to the United States Naval Base
Hospital at Brest. The disease was prevalent at the same time
among the French civil, military and naval groups in the same locality.
We see then that in the American Expeditionary Forces at any rate
the disease first occurred in two base ports receiving troops from the
United States. In May, 1918, a second outbreak was reported from
Tours, which lasted from May 1st to May 24th and affected 117
persons. Zinsser reports an epidemic at Chaumont during May and
from this time until July more or less extensive epidemics occurred
throughout the entire American Expeditionary Forces.</p>

<p class='c007'>Longcope remarks that the disease was likewise prevalent at this
time among the French population and in parts of the British Army.
The Influenza Committee of the British Advisory Board determined
that in the first British Army the disease became prevalent around
May 18th. Carnwath states that in the British Army in France the
epidemic began by a few local outbreaks in the first and second Armies
in April and May, 1918. Later it spread to the first, third and fourth
Armies and affected a very large proportion of the troops.</p>

<p class='c007'>Small describes two epidemics of influenza in one of the largest
General Hospitals of the British Expeditionary Force in France. He
says that the first wave began in April, 1918.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>The fact that MacNeal, as we have previously recorded, believed
that there was influenza in France in 1917, must not be overlooked.
Those earlier cases were scattered and did not so far as we know occur
in the form of small epidemics. Even if these were true influenza it is
reasonable to assume that they were sporadic cases and were not
genetically associated with the epidemic spreading from America and
daily increasing in virulence, which we are now following. MacNeal
concludes that epidemic influenza in France originated from the
endemic foci existing there, and that the disease was probably carried
from Europe to the United States by shipping. The author’s opinion
regarding the first direction of spread is that the reverse condition was
the actual process. Zinsser likewise holds the latter view.</p>

<p class='c007'>A most important observation made by MacNeal is that French
physicians practicing among the civilian population were perfectly
familiar with the disease when it appeared at Chaumont in April, 1918,
that they designated it as La Grippe, and stated that it had been
extensively prevalent in the civilian population of Chaumont from
March 15th to May 15th, 1918. These observations of influenza
occurring in France at almost the same date as the first outbreaks in
the United States is a matter of great interest. It has also been
stated by McNalty and by Carnwath, who quotes Kabeshima and Lee,
that the disease was prevalent in epidemic form in China and Japan
in March, 1918. We have here three foci from which the disease
may have primarily originated. There are two possibilities; first,
that it originated in all three foci (and perhaps others), and spread to
all parts of the world from each; second, that the virus, distributed
throughout the world, acquired high virulence in all three localities,
causing small epidemic outbreaks, but that the virus from only one
of these places finally became so exalted as to cause the pandemic.
Did the <i>pandemic</i> disease originate simultaneously in France, in
China and in the United States? One fact seems certain, that the
influenza which attacked our troops in Europe was influenza imported
from the United States. We have seen that it first appeared in the
American Expeditionary forces at the base ports. Alberto Lutraria,
Health Commissioner of Italy, has reported that the disease was
brought to that country from America. A point of significance is the
fact that during March and April there was an unusually large troop
movement from the United States to the American Expeditionary
Forces.</p>

<p class='c007'>MacNeal says: “The suggestion that the epidemic was introduced
from America is supported by the fact that it appeared at a time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>when large numbers of Americans were arriving in Europe, which is
indeed an outstanding feature correlated in time with the onset of the
epidemic.”</p>

<p class='c007'>According to the report of the Influenza Committee, the disease
was first seen in epidemic form in April and May in the British Armies
in France, but that was not the first time that Pfeiffer’s bacillus had
appeared within the armies. It had frequently been found in cases of
bronchopneumonia, especially during the winter of 1916–17. Carnwath
remarks that it is doubtful whether much importance from an
epidemiologic point of view attaches to these sporadic findings of
the influenza bacillus. In an outbreak of measles and rubella—complicated
by purulent bronchitis—which attacked men belonging
to the draft of troops from New Zealand between January 1st and
March 8th, 1918, the bacillus influenzae was present in twenty-four
of the forty sputa examined, and was grown in culture in twenty-one
cases. Sellards made somewhat similar observations on measles
patients at Camp Devens.</p>

<p class='c007'>Concerning the French population, Chauffard, Messary and
Netter, all remark that the first cases in France developed in April
with possibly some cases before that time, and that there were undoubtedly
cases in the German Army in April.</p>

<p class='c007'>We see then that by April the disease has been transferred to
France and is prevalent in the various armies. It is natural to assume
that the battle front would present no great obstacle to the spread
of the disease into the German Army. Gins remarks that the disease
was present on the German West front among the troops as early as
April, 1918, and that it spread from there more rapidly to the South
than to the North.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the month of May we observe the spread of the disease to
Great Britain, where Carnwath, who has made an exhaustive study of
the spread in Great Britain, believes that it was imported by the
troops from France. Its first recorded appearance in Glasgow was in
May. Dunlop, in reporting the successive epidemics in Scotland,
observed that in addition to the three well marked epidemics there
was a mild one recognizable in Glasgow in May, and that in that city
the death rate rose from 14.1 to 20.1, and the weekly number of
deaths from pneumonia and bronchitis from 36 to 107.</p>

<p class='c007'>In England the disease first attracted attention in June, appearing
first in the coast towns, chiefly at the beginning among the military
and naval forces. The civilian population was severely affected only
later. The ports which were earlier attacked were Portsmouth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Southampton and Liverpool. Inland towns suffered more severely
later.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the same month that the disease broke out in Scotland it
appeared in Spain. The Inspector General of Health in that country
reported that an epidemic of the disease began at Madrid in the last
half of May, 1918, at a period when there was an unusually large
gathering of people in the city. Within a short time it had spread
rapidly through all the provinces. The increase in death rate became
marked on the 27th of May and reached its peak on the 31st, at which
time the rate was twice that of the average annual death rate for that
period of the year. During the following week there was some
oscillation around the peak and then the curve fell away. The
epidemic was particularly severe at Madrid, Badajoz, and Seville.
It was mild at Barcelona.</p>

<p class='c007'>MacNeal remarks: “In Spain the disease appeared in epidemic
form about the middle of May and this outbreak received great
publicity, sufficient to lead to the popular appellation of Spanish
influenza. The very rapid and extensive spread of the disease in
Spain would indicate that it had been introduced from without rather
than transformed from the endemic state in that country. This also
appears to accord with the view of those who have studied the epidemic
in Spain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Filtzos reports that influenza first appeared in Greece toward the
end of May, 1918. The symptoms were slight and the people who
were attacked suffered for three or four days with fever, accompanied
by nervous symptoms. It was called at the time “Spanish Fever”.
Beginning with September the epidemic became worse and caused a
considerable rise in mortality. Complications with bronchopneumonia
appeared. The decrease in incidence began toward the middle
of December, 1918.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Benjafield, the pandemic first commenced in the
Egyptian Expeditionary Force in May, 1918, but the maximum incidence
was not reached until September and October. The cases
during the earlier period of the epidemic were on the whole mild in
type and of short duration, only a very small proportion being complicated
by bronchopneumonia. The epidemic continued from
November, through February, 1919, but the number of cases showed a
marked decrease during the last two months.</p>

<p class='c007'>The month of June saw the spread into England which we have
already described, and the continuation from the German West front
back into the enemy territory.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Rose reports that on the 3d of June, 1918, in Strasbourg the first
cases of influenza were reported in his hospital and that by the 15th
of the month the disease was practically epidemic. Wachter in
reporting cases from Frankfurt a. M. says that the cases of influenza
in that city appeared from the beginning of June, 1918. Schmorl
remarks that influenza became epidemic in Dresden in the beginning
of July, 1918. According to Koepchen, the disease was epidemic in
Bonn the 25th of June.</p>

<p class='c007'>An editorial comment in the Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift,
July 4, 1918, remarks that the influenza pandemic “which probably
has spread from Spain in the last few days” has appeared in several
places in Germany in the South and the North, and in Berlin. According
to the information received up to that time the disease was of
short duration and without severe complications. The issue of July
11th reports that the influenza epidemic appears to have already
passed its peak in Berlin and that in Süddeutschland the spread of the
epidemic has become very wide.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Office International d’Hygiène Publique records that the
pandemic spread throughout Switzerland towards the end of June,
1918, after having invaded a certain number of European states,
coming from various army fronts. It was at first of mild severity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Böhm states that the deaths from pneumonia and influenza in
Vienna began to show an increase in the week ending July 30th. In
August they returned to the normal rate. The second wave occurred
in Vienna in the middle of September.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the information at our disposal we are unable to determine
from what direction the pandemic entered either Switzerland or
Austria. The point of entry into Switzerland is of relatively little
importance in tracing the spread on the continent of Europe. Presumably
it entered from the north or northwest. The disease appeared
in Berne in June, reaching its height in that canton in the middle of
July and dying out in August (Sobernheim and Novkaovie).</p>

<p class='c007'>Information of the place of entrance into Spain is also rather
indefinite. We are told that Barcelona was one of the cities attacked
early. Barcelona is situated on the Mediterranean near the French
border and is quite directly connected by commerce with Marseilles
and other French ports on the Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='c007'>In June the disease had also spread to Norway and outside of
Europe to the West Indies, South America, India and China. A short
notice in the Public Health Reports tells us that epidemic influenza
with an estimated number of 1,500 cases began in Christiania, Norway,
about June 15th.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Atiles relates that influenza appeared in Porto Rico in June, soon
after the arrival of a ship from Spain. It spread rapidly, and it is
estimated that at one time fully eight per cent. of the entire population
had the disease simultaneously, and that forty per cent. of the population
were affected during the epidemic.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Health Officer at Bombay made report in July, 1918, on an
influenza-like disease then spreading throughout India. It was stated
that the disease was introduced into Bombay from overseas by a transport
which arrived May 31, 1918; that by June 22d the disease had
become epidemic at Bombay, and that it was present in July, 1918,
at Calcutta and Madras.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rapid spread from Europe to distant India may be accounted
for with the same mechanism as that by which the disease was spread
from America to France and from France to England, viz. by army
transports. The occurrence of the disease in Porto Rico appears to
have been definitely connected with the arrival of a ship from Spain.
A very short notice in the Public Health Reports tells us that influenza
was reported present at Santos, Brazil, June 16, 1918. We are
not informed as to how it reached that place.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have discovered no mention of influenza in China in June. It
was reported present in Chungking, China, July 27th. and at that
time one-half of the population was stated to be affected. Dengue
was reported prevalent at Chefoo, China, during the two weeks ended
June 15, 1918, and a report from Shanghai of the same date describes
the prevalence of a disease resembling dengue and affecting about 50
per cent. of the population. The disease in these two latter places
may have been influenza.</p>

<p class='c007'>The epidemic made its appearance in Korea in September, 1918.
Schofield and Cynn, who report the epidemic, believe that the infection
came from Europe via Siberia. The disease spread from North
to South along the line of the Southern Manchurian Railway.</p>

<p class='c007'>In August the disease was re-introduced into the United States
and by the end of that month it had acquired a foothold in Boston
and vicinity and rapidly spread to other parts of the country. The
pandemic had crossed the Atlantic in both directions in six months’
time.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1918 as in 1889 there are excellent descriptions of the conveyance
of the disease by vessels. The transfer from Spain to Porto
Rico has been mentioned. Escomel says that the outbreak in Rio de
Janeiro was ascribed to infection from a steamship from Spain, the
same boat which later visited Buenos Ayres and started the epidemic
in the latter city.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>According to a report to the Journal of the American Medical
Association from Mexico the epidemic invaded that country from the
North at Laredo and followed the course from North to South. From
a similar source the same Journal reports that the influenza spread
from Buenos Ayres as a primary focus to Paraguay and there acquired
greater virulence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hernando reports from the Philippine Islands that influenza was
estimated to have attacked forty per cent. of the total population of
7,000,000 the mortality being about 2.5 per cent. of those attacked.
The epidemic really began in June, although it did not assume great
severity until October. The group of ages that suffered most were
those between ten and twenty-nine years. The disease did not seem
to be imported, since cases were returned before any ships arrived
from infected countries, although after the importation of cases it
assumed a more severe form. The June epidemic seemed to confer
a certain degree of immunity during the second outbreak of the
disease in October.</p>

<p class='c007'>Erlendsson reports that the influenza when it appeared in Iceland
in November, 1918, corresponded in character with that in other
portions of the world. Macklin gives an interesting description of
the epidemic as it occurred in Lapland. The onset in that territory
was probably in November. He found that many individuals recovered
in two or three days and were about their work again feeling
perfectly well. If, however, they contracted pneumonia, about fifty
per cent. died.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Laplanders had a very thorough if unsympathetic way of
dealing with their cases. The settlements were composed of wooden
huts, small but generally well made and warm. A common type
consisted of but one room, used by the family for all purposes. Better
class Laps had better huts, with two or three rooms. In each settlement
one of the single-room huts had been set apart, and into this
each case of sickness as it arose was unceremoniously pushed; and
none were permitted to return to their own huts until completely
recovered. Whilst there they received practically no attention, and
no healthy person ever entered to attend to their wants. Occasionally
a bowl of water or reindeer milk was hastily passed in at the door,
or a huge chunk of reindeer meat thrown in, uncooked and uncarved.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We visited every settlement within our reach and entered these
huts. The stench on opening the door met one like a poison blast
and the rooms were nearly always ill lighted and dark. The patients
lay littered about the floor in a crowded mass, fully dressed in clothes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>and boots (most of them had no socks), and with no other cover but
an occasional greasy rug. Although the outside air was cold and the
ground snow-covered, the temperature inside, maintained by the
combined mass of bodies, was generally sufficiently high. The patients
in these huts included both sexes and all ages; some, when we entered,
sat up and with flushed faces and dull, uncomprehending eyes watched
us listlessly. Others lay restlessly twisting about, quite incapable
of taking any interest or of answering any questions.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The epidemic struck Alaska in October, invading first the towns of
the sea coast, being very evidently brought thither by steamer.
Travel to the interior was stopped and so the latter escaped, to a great
extent, the outbreak. At Kodiak and on Cook Inlet, the mortality
was extremely high. Whole villages of esquimaux lost their entire
adult population. Many infants were frozen in their dead mothers’
arms.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Influenza in China.</i>—We have been able to follow the pandemic
quite consecutively as it has spread around the world, from a first
outbreak in the United States in March, 1918. We repeat that the
disease was presumably present in Europe and elsewhere previous
to that time, as it was in America, but the particular virus which
ultimately acquired sufficient virulence to produce the pandemic may
well be that which came from North America. Did this virus arise
from an endemic focus in this continent, or was it transported to us at
a somewhat earlier date from Asia?</p>

<p class='c007'>McNalty states that influenza was present in China and in the
Japanese Navy in March of 1918. He gives no reference. Carnwath
makes the same statement and gives as reference the report of Kabeshima
and Lee. The author has not been able to obtain this report.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Health Officer of Shanghai made the following report for May,
1918: “Towards the end of the month, reports were received of
outbreaks of ‘fever’ which rapidly affected a large proportion of the
employees of various offices, shops, police stations, etc. As a result of
clinical and laboratory observations of cases admitted to the Chinese
Isolation Hospital the disease was recognized as epidemic influenza.
The same disease was reported to have appeared in Peking before
reaching Shanghai, but subsequent reports showed that most of the
river ports were almost simultaneously infected; that is to say the
rate of spread conformed to the rate of conveyance by railways and
boats of infected persons;”</p>

<p class='c007'>In November of 1918 an editorial note in the China Medical
Journal reads as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“From nearly all parts of China reports are being sent to the newspapers
of the occurrence of a severe epidemic of disease which seems
to manifest itself in various forms. In Wusuch, where the disease is
called ‘the five days’ plague’ the symptoms are said to be not unlike
those of cholera, death in some cases ensuing in less than a day. In
other cases it is complicated by severe and often fatal pneumonia.
At Anking many cases have all the symptoms of typhoid fever, but
the mortality is great and sudden. In one house four people died
within a few hours of each other, and in another house eight persons
out of eleven died. At Wuhu and other of the lower Yangtze ports
it is said to resemble dengue fever and the mortality is so great that
undertakers are finding it difficult to meet the demand for coffins. In
Shansi, where the victims literally number thousands, the disease
is regarded as influenza. In Peking fully fifty per cent. of the Chinese
have been affected and the mortality has been heavy. Accurate
reports from medical men in these cities would be very instructive.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The author has the following personal communication from Doctor
Arthur Stanley of the Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal
Council. “Influenza fever appeared during the recent epidemic in
Shanghai towards the end of May 1918. It swept over the whole
country like a tidal wave. You may take it that it spread like most
rapid extant means of transit. A primary source of origin was not
made known.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is to be hoped that more definite and concurrent information
will be forthcoming in the case of China. A thorough search of the
literature as reviewed for China and Japan in the China Medical
Journal reveals no description of the disease previous to April or
May of 1918. Nevertheless we must assume that, until contradictory
reports are made, the disease was present in those countries in March as
stated by Carnwath.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Autumn Spread in the United States.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>By the first of July, 1918, convalescent cases of influenza began
to appear among members of the crews of transports and other vessels
arriving in Boston from European ports. The number of such cases
on each ship was usually not more than four or five, but Woodward
records that in one or two instances between twenty and twenty-five
individuals were sick on incoming vessels. None of these were
seriously ill, none were sent to the hospital, and none died. The
disease in this class of persons did not become severe until late August.
Woodward has found on inquiry among practising physicians that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>typical cases of influenza were seen with notable frequency in private
practice in the vicinity of Boston during the month of August, and
that they had developed no serious complications, the only after effect
being the marked prostration.</p>

<p class='c007'>These mild preliminary cases failed to attract attention; first,
because of their relative scarcity, and second because of their benign
character. Public attention was first directed to the influenza in
Boston by the apparently sudden appearance during the week ending
August 28th of about fifty cases at the Naval Station at Commonwealth
Pier. Within the next two weeks over 2,000 cases had occurred
in the Naval forces of the First Naval District. One week later there
was a similar sudden outbreak in the Aviation School and among the
Naval Radio men at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The
first death in Boston was reported on September 8th.</p>

<p class='c007'>The peak of daily incidence in Boston occurred around the first of
October. In the week ending October 5th a total of 1,214 deaths from
influenza and pneumonia was reported, while by the third week of
October this total had fallen to less than 600, and for the week ending
November 9th was down to 47. Around November 15th the number
of cases rather suddenly increased and this recurrent wave lasted for
about ten days. By the 25th the rate was back to what it had been
around the first of the same month. On or about December 1st the
incidence again rose and continued increasing daily, to reach its peak
in a severe recrudescence around December 31st.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are conflicting reports concerning the date of first appearance
of the epidemic at Camp Devens, Massachusetts. Woodward says
that a sudden and very significant increase was reported during the
third week in August in the number of cases of pneumonia occurring
in the army cantonment at Camp Devens, seeming to justify the
statement that an influenza epidemic may have started among the
soldiers there even before it appeared in the naval forces. Soper, on
the other hand, as well as Howard and Love in their official report,
place the date of the first case at Devens as September 7th. Soper
remarks: “The Devens epidemic is supposed to have commenced on
September 7, 1918, in D Company, 42d Infantry. On that date a case
of supposed meningitis was sent to the hospital from this company;
on the following day twelve cases were sent for observation. These
proved to be influenza. By the 16th thirty-seven cases had gone from
the same company.” Howard and Love state, “The first authentic
cases of virulent influenza of the great autumn pandemic among
troops in the United States appeared on September 7, 1918, at Camp
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Devens, Mass.” These statements by Howard and Love do not
eliminate the possibility of earlier and less virulent unrecognized
cases. Wooley, who was camp epidemiologist, reports that influenza
began at Camp Devens on the 8th of September, 1918. It reached
its acme on the 16th, 17th and 18th of the month and then rapidly
declined, almost completely vanishing about the middle of November.
He makes no observation as to whether a mild form of the disease
was or was not present in the camp in March and April preceding.</p>

<p class='c007'>Influenza entered Massachusetts at Boston. Reeks reports that
it entered Connecticut at New London, the cases coming primarily
from the experimental station and from Fort Trumbull, where vessels
from foreign ports had discharged patients. He believes that the
disease was first introduced by ships arriving in New London from
abroad and by men from the Boston Navy Yard, but numerous foci
developed in a short period of time in various parts of the state.
Many of these had appeared by the middle of September, and the
source, according to Winslow and Rogers, was traced to military
establishments, chiefly Camp Devens. In Wallingford, Willimantic,
Hartland, Rockville and Danbury, all of which towns were attacked
early in the epidemic, investigation showed that the disease developed
in each case two or three days after visits of soldiers from Camp
Devens. In Connecticut the epidemic spread, beginning at New
London, chiefly from east to west, reaching its peak in the Eastern
section around October 4th, in the central section October 15th, and
in the Western part of the state around October 24th. Towns which
had been infected early by visitors from military establishments
reached the climax sooner than other towns nearby. In spreading
from New London north and west the large cities of Connecticut were
successively invaded, New Haven and Hartford reaching their crest
about ten days later than New London, while Fairfield County did not
reach its acme until later than New Haven.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the cities along the New England coast we see then that the disease
reached epidemic proportions early in September. By September
21st it had become epidemic in a wide area along the Atlantic coast
extending from the Southern part of Maine to Virginia, as well as in a
number of localities scattered over the entire country. By September
28th, areas adjacent to the centers in which the epidemic had already
appeared were affected, suggesting radial movement from these
centers. By that time the greater part of the New England States,
the North Atlantic and Central States, and some of the Gulf and
Pacific Coast States had become involved. By October 5th the
pandemic had apparently reached all parts of the country with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>exception of the more isolated rural districts and some areas in the
Central States and Mountain States. Within an additional ten days
even these areas, with the exception of the very remote rural districts,
had been reached by the epidemic. Within four weeks the disease
had become distributed to all sections of the country, and within six
weeks from its first epidemic prevalence in Boston practically the
entire country had been invaded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sydenstricker in a preliminary report remarks on the fact that the
disease reached an epidemic stage in a number of localities in the
central, northern, southern and western sections at about the same
time as it did in the area along the northeastern coast. “The possibility
is suggested, therefore, that sources of infection existed in at
least some of the larger population centers, well distributed through
the country, some time before the disease appeared as a nation-wide
epidemic. The apparent radial spread of the epidemic from certain
centers would seem to strengthen this hypothesis. It may also be
noted that there is evidence, the collection of which has not yet been
completed, pointing to the existence of cases of the disease in various
centers, probably widely distributed, weeks before they were definitely
recognized as influenza. The possibility that these foci themselves
had a common focus is by no means excluded, of course, but there is as
yet no conclusive evidence that would warrant the statement that the
starting point of the epidemic was Boston or any specific locality.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dublin, from a study of the statistics of the Metropolitan Life
Insurance Company, finds that the virulence of the influenza, as
indicated by the mortality rate, was greatest along the Atlantic Coast
and became progressively less as it progressed westward. There was
one exception. The mortality was high in San Francisco, higher than
in other western communities. Dublin believes that quite possibly
there was a double infection in San Francisco in the fall of 1918, one
coming from the East and of small caliber, while the other came either
by way of the Panama Canal or perhaps from Asia. The evidence in
favor of two ways is that Dublin finds that the peak of incidence in
San Francisco and in some other places on the Pacific Coast occurred
sometime in advance of the similar peak at points inland from the
coast. This is not brought out in Pearl’s chart, and the latter finds
when considering the peak of deaths that the peak for San Francisco
was late. The peak in that city, in Oakland, California, and in Los
Angeles, was reached on the week ending November 2d. Few cities
had as late death peaks. Cleveland and Pittsburgh reached their
peak in the same week, St. Paul, Minnesota in the week ending
November 16th, and St. Louis, Milwaukee and Grand Rapids not until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>the week ending December 14th. In the case of Milwaukee and St.
Louis these were the high peak dates but they were second peaks.
In the former the first peak occurred October 26th and in the latter
November 2d. In Grand Rapids the increase in mortality was clearcut
by the middle of October, although the peak was not reached until
the week ending December 14th. These statistics would indicate
that San Francisco was attacked, as evidenced by increase in death
reports, relatively late, and at about the time that would be necessary
for the disease to be carried across the continent.</p>

<p class='c007'>In an article by Ely, Lloyd, Hitchcock and Nickson it is said that
influenza first appeared in the Puget Sound Navy Yard, near Seattle,
on September 17, 1918, and that it was introduced by a draft of 987
sailors received from Philadelphia, a number of whom arrived ill, or
came down within a few hours after reaching their destination. As a
result, Seattle and the State of Washington were infected somewhat
ahead of the other West Coast States. According to the record,
influenza did not assume epidemic proportions in the State of Oregon
for nearly a month after this Navy Yard epidemic.</p>

<p class='c007'>With army camps and cantonments situated in nearly every section
of the country it is difficult to follow the general direction of spread
from camp to camp. During the period of the epidemic, troop movements
were in general from West to East toward points of embarkation
rather than in the reverse direction. This was in the opposite direction
to that taken by the pandemic. Away from the coast there were,
however, many movements of troops from camp to camp, in the redistribution
of forces. That these troop movements were not discontinued
during the epidemic is indicated by the report of Howard and
Love: “The virulent type of influenza had spread rapidly from camp
to camp, from the Atlantic seaboard to the South and West, due to the
continual interchange of personnel from infected to non-infected camps.
Such movements of troops at this time were recognized as dangerous
and inadvisable, and prompt recommendations were made by the
Medical Department that such movements be discontinued or greatly
restricted, if compatible with military interests, which, of course,
were at the time paramount. The War Department was unable to
approve any marked restriction of movement of men from camp to
camp at this time. One result of the free inter-communication of
military personnel was that practically all military stations in the
United States were in the throes of the epidemic at the same time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In addition to this means of inter-communication we had the possibility
of spread to the various camps by the ordinary course of civilian
and commercial travel as in spread to different communities, and also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>the possibility of importing large amounts of virus at one time on the
incoming trains with new draft troops.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Howard and Love have established definitely that the extension of
the virulent influenza from Camp Devens to other camps south and
west in September, 1918, can be traced in many instances directly
to the interchange of military personnel from infected to non-infected
camps. The height of the September outbreak in the United States
Army extended over a period of about nine weeks, from Sept. 13th to
November 15th, and during this period over 20,000 deaths occurred
among troops in the United States alone in excess of the number that
would have occurred, if the disease death rate for the corresponding
period of the preceding year had prevailed.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is interesting to note with respect to Camp Humphreys, Virginia,
that there were possibly some sporadic cases previous to the autumn
outbreak. Brewer in reporting on the epidemic in September and
October records the first case as having occurred shortly after July
1st. He makes no mention of there having been any outbreak whatever
prior to that date. Between July 1st and September 12th there
were only sporadic cases diagnosed as influenza. The autumn outbreak
began at Camp Humphreys September 13th and ended October
18th.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Recrudescences.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>We have already seen from the work of Pearl that recrudescences
following the original spread in any one locality were the rule rather
than the exception in this country. He found that in sixty-five per
cent. of the forty cities studied there were two distinct peaks in the
mortality curve and in twenty per cent. there were three, while only
fifteen per cent. had but one peak. The first peak was as a rule the
highest. Although there was no absolute regularity in the time of
occurrence of the recrudescences, Pearl established that the high peak
cities had the second peaks on an average 7.1 weeks after the first, and
the third peak on an average 13.1 weeks after the second. The two-peak
cities are divided into two classes, the first comprising about a
third of the total number, had the second mortality peak around eight
weeks after the first, while the remaining two-thirds had the second
peak about thirteen weeks after the first. The cycle in the epidemic
wave appears to be nearly a multiple of seven weeks. He suggests
that the smaller group of two-peak cities with early second peak may
have been cities which at the time were presumably destined to show a
third distinct wave and peak of mortality, but in which for some reason
not now apparent the third wave did not eventuate. In contradistinction
the larger group of two-peak cities with the second peak
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>occurring around thirteen weeks after the first are presumably cities
in which the complex of factors determining the form of the mortality
curve was such as to lead definitely to a two and only two-peak curve.
In three-peak cities the first interval was around seven weeks, the
second around thirteen weeks. The two-peak cities with an interval
around thirteen were probably not destined, according to Pearl, to
have another repetition, but those with an interval of seven were
presumably destined to have a second interval, the thirteen-week
interval, which for some reason did not occur.</p>

<p class='c007'>This raises the question of periodicity, a subject which we will
discuss at a more appropriate place.</p>

<p class='c007'>This experience of recrudescences was similar in the American
Expeditionary Forces. The first outbreak lasted through April and
May and into June. The second came in September and October.
The spring epidemic had been characterized by mildness and was
known as three-day fever, but in the autumn, complications of the
respiratory tract predominated in the symptom complex. By August
18th a severe epidemic had occurred in an artillery camp at La Valdahon
in the Jura Mountains, near Bezançon. Early in September a
larger epidemic occurred in an artillery camp near Bordeaux. The
epidemic in our troops in France, as well as in the French civil and
military population, reached its height during October. The Service
of Supply was more heavily affected than were the troops situated on
the battle front. The morbidity rate appeared to have been almost
the same as that in the United States. That it was not quite as high
has been shown by Howard and Love. Longcope states that it prevailed
particularly among the troops at the base ports where during a
part of the epidemic transports laden with infected troops were being
landed; in those organizations which contained the largest number of
replacement troops; and in organizations being moved on troop trains,
where the men were necessarily closely crowded.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second outbreak subsided during the early part of November.
A third occurred in January and February, very much as it had done in
the United States. In the interval between the second and third
recurrences there was no time at which the entire Expeditionary Forces
were free from the disease. The author had occasion to study an
outbreak occurring early in December in the 26th Division stationed
in rest area at Montigny-le-Roi. In this outbreak the respiratory
complications predominated, as in October, and the mortality was
comparatively high. We had had occasion to study the same disease
at Camp Sevier, South Carolina in September and early October, 1918,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>and in two different localities in France in December, 1918, and February,
1919, and found that the clinical characteristics were identical
on both continents.</p>

<p class='c007'>The more severe recurrence in England, in October, has been carefully
studied. In fact this recurrence was almost universal in all
countries. The autumn epidemic has been reported as being at its
height in October, 1918, in such widely separated localities as the
United States, England, France, Greece, Brazil, India, Japan and
Korea.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Europe at any rate the third wave occurring in the winter of
1919 was quite generally distributed. At about the same time the
disease broke out in England, making a third wave in less than a year.
Once again the third attack began less suddenly and less violently and
resulted in a lower number of fatalities. During February there was
reported to have been a great increase in the number of cases in Paris.
It had terminated by March 27, 1919. In March the disease broke
out anew, this time assuming grave proportions, not only in that city
but in several of the Departments.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second recrudescence has also been reported as being present
in Spain.</p>

<p class='c007'>On May 5, 1919, report was received from Buenos Ayres that in
one of the concentration zones for naval troops located in the harbor
there had been an epidemic of short duration, but with high morbidity,
with two hundred cases being frequently reported each day.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just as Pearl has observed a certain periodic recrudescence in the
United States, there has been described a similar periodicity in England.
The interval, however, is described as twelve weeks. The first wave
began in July and died down about the end of August, running a two
months course. Twelve weeks after the commencement of the first
wave, at the beginning of October, the second appeared. It had disappeared
around the middle of December. Again, twelve weeks from
the beginning of the second wave, that is, in January, the third
appeared.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Recurrences in Winter of 1919–1920.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>We distinguish between the flareups following the autumn spread
of 1918, and which lasted until the spring of 1919, and yet another
widely distributed recurrence in the winter of 1920. We have called
the former recrudescences to distinguish them in point of time from the
latter, but do not imply thereby any difference in the character or
origin of the secondary waves. Between them all there occurred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>almost continuously isolated or solitary cases of influenza which
served to keep the fires smouldering. In our own work in the city
of Boston we found record of scattered infrequent cases of clinical
influenza of apparently low infectivity in every month from March,
1919, until the recurrence in January, 1920.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moreover, in some localities there were during this interval small
epidemic outbreaks. Thus a report from Lisbon, Portugal, on June
1, 1919, states that the deaths from influenza in that city during the
preceding two weeks had been more than the total deaths from all
causes during the preceding four months. A report from London,
October 30, 1919, states that during the preceding few weeks there
had been in the ninety-six great towns of England and Wales a slight
but gradual increase in the number of deaths attributed to the disease,
and a coincident rise in the number of notifications of acute primary
and acute influenzal pneumonia. The feeling at that time was that
the increase was associated with prevailing meteorological conditions,
and did not apparently signify more than the usual variation in respiratory
diseases which was to be expected at that season of the year.
On November 3, 1919, the disease was reported prevailing at Chile
and it was spreading throughout Bolivia. At the same time influenza
had spread over the entire country surrounding Buenos Ayres and had
even reached the neighboring city of Montevideo. In the latter part
of November more than 2,000 cases had been reported at Lemaies,
about fifteen miles northeast of Granada, Spain.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The winter of 1920.</i>—In the United States the death rates from
influenza and pneumonia in the large cities over the entire country were
below the usual average from May, 1919, until January 1, 1920. In
the week ending January 17th there was a sharp increase in the influenza-pneumonia
rate, which occurred simultaneously in Kansas City
and Chicago. In the latter city an excess over the average was not
reached until some days later, but the maximum mortality occurred
in the week ending January 31st, while in Kansas City the mortality
did not reach its height until one week later. New York, Washington,
San Francisco, Milwaukee and St. Paul soon followed with an increase
in the week ending January 24th, and in the subsequent two weeks
many other cities were added to the list. By February 14th thirty-two
out of the thirty-six large cities reporting had an increase in the
death rate from influenza and pneumonia as compared with the same
period in 1917. The maximum was reached at this time, and according
to the Bureau of the Census reports there were 7,059 deaths from
influenza and pneumonia during the week ending February 14th. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>the next week the number of deaths from these causes in the cities
reporting had dropped to 5,088. The February weekly average for
1917 was 1,489. In the week ending February 14th, 267,643 cases
of influenza were reported from forty-one states; the excess annual
death rate as compared with the average for the period from 1910
to 1916 was 1,319.</p>

<p class='c007'>In general the 1920 recurrence was decidedly milder than the
autumn outbreak of 1918. Certain cities, however, suffered severely,
particularly Detroit, Milwaukee, Kansas City, Minneapolis and St.
Louis. In these the death rate, while the epidemic lasted, was higher
than that of 1918. The duration of the epidemic was generally,
however, shorter in these cities. Columbus, Ohio, and Indianapolis
suffered severely, but to a less extent than the cities just mentioned.
In Chicago the death rate was not as high as in the fall of 1918, but
it did rise far above the point reached during the 1889–90 outbreak,
and the influenza in the last two weeks of January brought the total
mortality for that month up to 5,149, the highest mortality in the
history of the city with the exception of October, 1918.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have already discussed the recurrent epidemic as it was studied
in Detroit. The salient characteristics were a rapid and fairly symmetrical
evolution, a shorter duration than in 1918, a lower morbidity
with a higher mortality rate, and finally, a smaller total number of
deaths than in 1918.</p>

<p class='c007'>The 1920 recurrence was widespread. It was not confined
entirely to the large cities. Semi-official reports from small towns and
villages show very much the same conditions as were observed in the
larger cities. On the whole, however, most communities, both large
and small, suffered less severely than in the first spread. The few
exceptions to this were distributed over the continent without
uniformity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first among the large cities to show an increase in death rate
from the epidemic was Kansas City, in which the mortality first
climbed in the week ending January 17th. The following week there
was an increased rate in Chicago, New York and Milwaukee, and one
week later, Boston, Detroit, San Francisco and Philadelphia were
affected. New Orleans was one of the last large cities affected, not
showing a definite increase until the week ending February 14th. In
contrast to the 1918 pandemic, the influenza of 1920 showed no clearcut
direction of spread, and was as in the years following 1889 due,
without doubt, to firing up of the pandemic virus as it had been left
scattered in many endemic foci throughout the earth. There probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>were instances of spread from the larger centers to outlying districts,
but there was no continuous spread over large areas. The accompanying
table shows clearly that the disease this year commenced in the
center of the continent, a fact which would seem to disconnect it entirely
from the late epidemics of 1919, occurring in Europe:</p>

<p class='c007'>The relative severity of the two epidemics in certain of the large
cities has been compared by H. F. Vaughan, and he has found as is seen
by the table that Kansas City and Detroit, two of the early cities
affected, had the highest mortality in 1920. Philadelphia in 1918 lost
nearly three times as many people as Detroit did in 1920. Detroit
was higher than Chicago in 1920, but lower in 1918.</p>

mortality climbed first on the week ending January 13th, as in the table

earlier. It is characteristic of influenza epidemics that the rise of

<p class='c007'>In Massachusetts in the first three months of 1920 there were
reported 35,633 cases of influenza and 3,158 of lobar pneumonia, with
906 deaths from the former disease and 1102 from the latter. The
case rate per 100,000 from influenza was 883.4; from lobar pneumonia,
78.3; the death rate from influenza, 22.4; from lobar pneumonia, 27.4;
and the fatality per cent. from the former disease was 2.5, and from
the latter, 34.9.</p>

<p class='c007'>The epidemics in Detroit and Boston both showed a symmetrical
evolution and a single wave. This appears to have been the more
frequent type of recurrence in this country. There are examples of
the secondary curve. At the Great Lakes Naval Training Station
the epidemic began during the week ending January 17th. On
January 12th there were fifty-one cases. The peak was reached on the
third day with the admission of 182 new cases during twenty-four
hours. Although the peak came early the decline was less rapid and
there were four secondary peaks, but the outbreak terminated on the
twenty-fourth day. On the whole the epidemic was less severe than
in 1918. Pneumonia was a complication in about ten per cent. of the
reported cases of influenza at the training station.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the European continent there were similar recurrences in the
first three months of 1920. In the large towns of England the recorded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>deaths from influenza made an increase in a steady curve from sixty-six
in the last week of January until the week ending March 27th.
After that date there was a gradual falling off. That the situation
was in no way as serious as it was at the same time in the American
cities and in certain other parts of Europe is indicated by an annotation
in the Lancet of March 6th. According to this annotation, the
weekly totals of deaths attributed to influenza in London and the 96
great towns had on the whole tended to increase in the early part of
1920, but the absolute increment was so small and the necessary
uncertainty of classification so great that no unfavorable inferences
could be drawn from these fluctuations alone. On the other hand, the
notifications of cases of pneumonia increased appreciably, too much to
be set down as a mere chance fluctuation. But notification for this
disease had not been in force long enough to enable accurate comparison.
There were no indications of epidemic influenza in any of the
large factories situated throughout the country. But on the other
hand there was proof of the existence of epidemic influenza of an
infectious, but relatively non-fatal type in certain large schools situated
in the South and Southwest of England.</p>

<p class='c007'>The annotation concludes that influenza was epidemic in a few
localized English and Welsh communities, and that the type was
similar to, but less severe than that of 1918–19.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the city of Paris between the 11th and 31st of January there
was a very definite increase in the death rate from inflammation of the
respiratory tract above the average for other years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Renon and Mignot studied 141 cases of influenza (71 men and 70
women) during January and February, 1920, at L’Hopital Necker.
Fifteen of the 141 died. According to these observers the grip of
1920 attacked all ages in contradistinction to the 1918 epidemic which
affected especially the young and vigorous. One-third of their group
were over forty years of age, while some were seventy and eighty years
old. In spite of this the disease remained relatively mild. Sixty-four
were cases of simple grip. Forty-three had associated bronchitis
and pulmonary congestion and edema. Twenty-seven had pneumonia.
One had acute pulmonary edema. There were cases of
influenza in tuberculosis individuals. One developed an acute serofibrinous
pleurisy. One had purulent pleurisy, and one meningitis.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Copenhagen there occurred between the 18th and 24th of
January, 1920, 1,204 cases of influenza with four deaths; in the following
week, from the 25th to the 31st of January, 7,445 cases with forty-two
deaths; from the 1st to the 7th of February, 11,038 cases with 207
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>deaths; from the 8th to the 14th of February, 8,308 cases and 327
deaths. This is to be contrasted with the month of December, 1919,
in which there were 1,845 cases of influenza in Denmark, of which only
272 were at Copenhagen. In Christiania, Norway, during the week
of January 25th to 31st, there occurred eleven deaths from influenza,
whereas during the preceding two weeks there had not been a single
death from this disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>In December, 1919, there were reported in Switzerland only 511
cases of influenza. During the month of January, 1920, this increased
to 13,162, and in February to 83,008, the estimated population being
4,000,000. From February the disease decreased in prevalence. In
Zurich, with a population of 210,000, the epidemic resulted in 14,534
cases. The first increase began around January 4th. The total
number of cases for January was 1,071. In February the records of the
four weeks showed 2,721, 4,140, 3,341 and 1,899 cases, respectively;
in March the decrease was rapid, 886, 442 and 45 cases being reported
in the first three weeks. The total number of deaths, mostly due to
pneumonia, was 229, a mortality of 1.5 per cent.</p>

<p class='c007'>During 1920 epidemics were also observed in Valencia, Santander
and other towns in Spain, and in Mexico City. In the latter city the
number of deaths was reported as 1,649, as contrasted with 3,000 in
1918.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Incubation Period.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>An accurate determination of the period of incubation in influenza
presents great difficulties. The large number of cases with the consequent
multiple opportunities for infection in the case of every individual
add to the difficulty. Under any circumstances the period is
very short. Parkes, many years before the 1889 epidemic, believed
that an incubative period sometimes exists; that it was sometimes
very short and sometimes of many days duration.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the Transactions of the College of Physicians it is stated that
in the epidemic of 1782, seventeen persons came to London to an
hotel, and on the following day three were attacked with influenza.
Haygarth says that a gentleman came to Chester from London, on
the 24th of May, 1782, ill of influenza; a lady, into whose family he
came, was seized on the 26th, and was the first case in the town.
Haygarth states, evidently with the view to point out the possibility
of a direct contagion, that the gentleman was engaged to be, and was
afterwards, married to this lady. In this case the longest possible
incubative period was two days. In 1782 a family landed at Harwich,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>from Portugal, and came to London directly; the day after their arrival
the lady, two servants and two children were all seized. Two men-of-war
arrived at Gravesend from the West Indies; three Custom-house
officers went on board; a few hours afterwards the crews of both vessels
were attacked. Some other cases are on record where the incubative
period, if it existed, could not have been more than a single day. On
the other hand, some cases are on record in which the incubative
period must have been two or three weeks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Leichtenstern believed that the usual incubation period is from
one to three days although some cases have been reported in which it is
without doubt no longer than twelve hours. Parsons in reporting
for England also gives the incubation period as from one to three days
as a rule.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is reported in France in 1918 that in one institution thirty-one
cases out of thirty-three individuals occurred within three days, all of
them infected by one nurse.</p>

<p class='c007'>MacDonald and Lyth report in the British Medical Journal for
November, 1918, an interesting observation concerning the incubation
period in influenza. These two individuals were traveling from London
to York in the same compartment with an individual who was just
convalescing from influenza. Exactly forty-one hours after being on
the train with this individual, they both came down with the disease.
One suffered lightly while the other was severely ill. The wife and
two children of the latter contracted the disease in turn, and with
them also the first symptoms appeared suddenly after a delay of
about forty-eight hours.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stanley, in studying the epidemics of influenza in San Quentin
Prison, found that as a rule there was an increase in incidence following
the Sunday picture shows. This usually occurred on Tuesdays
and Wednesdays, giving an apparent incubation period of from
thirty-six to sixty hours. He tabulated the records of twenty-nine
individuals who had presumably become exposed at the show and
found that the incubation period averaged about forty-eight hours.</p>

<p class='c007'>The majority of observers give the incubation period as from
twenty-four hours to four or five days, most often two or three days.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Predisposing Causes.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>Not every individual acquires influenza. There are those who
assume that the disease is so wide spread that every individual in each
community attacked has been actually exposed to the disease. In
that case there must be a certain amount of natural immunity which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>protects around sixty to eighty per cent. of most populations from the
disease. The other extreme would be that every exposed individual
falls victim to the disease and that only twenty to thirty or forty per
cent. are actually exposed. The true state probably lies between
these two extremes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless it is a fact that some individuals naturally insusceptible
to the disease fall victim as a result of the action of some extraneous
force, something which lowers their resistance. Raw recruits in the
army camps in the fall of 1918 contracted the disease in much greater
proportion than did the hardened soldiers. Fatigue, intercurrent
illness, environmental changes and exposure to inclement weather may
all predispose to infection in the individual. Greenwood found that
the compulsory rationing of food in England during the war was
probably not a predisposing cause of infection. The incidence of the
disease in the South Africa Union where food was abundant was even
higher than that for the British Isles. Hamer calls attention to the
fact that the ages of highest incidence during the pandemic were those
ages in which the diet was perhaps more restricted than in other ages.
This, however, is but one factor and cannot be accepted as conclusive.</p>

<p class='c007'>It had been suggested that in the army camps in the United States
typhoid vaccination during the epidemic predisposed to the disease.
The similarity of the symptoms in vaccine reaction and in influenza
may have suggested this. V. C. Vaughan has investigated this possibility
and finds that those organizations in which anti-typhoid vaccine
was discontinued for a time after the appearance of the influenza
suffered quite as severely as those which submitted to vaccination.</p>

<p class='c007'>Other predisposing causes, such as the incidence of crowding in a
household and the sanitary surroundings of the individual will be
discussed later.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Periodicity.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>The phenomenon of occurrence of epidemic influenza in many
countries, even on different continents almost simultaneously and
often without any clearcut progressive spread from one of these countries
to another raises the question of periodicity in influenza. Is this
simultaneous occurrence due to some mechanism in the life cycle of the
influenza virus whereby it regularly acquires increased invasiveness,
no matter what its geographical distribution, or is it merely a feature
of the meteorologic conditions that makes the epidemic appear to be
simultaneous in widely scattered communities?</p>

<p class='c007'>Influenza characteristically returns. An influenza period usually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>comprises from three to five years, with one or two very mild epidemics
at the beginning which may frequently be overlooked, then of wide
pandemic spread, to be followed by endemic recurrences for as long as
two or three years. During these influenza periods the intervals
between waves are frequently so nearly equal or multiples of each
other as to force the question of a periodic law. Not only thus, but
even on a larger scale does the disease appear with a certain uniform
regularity. The great epidemics are separated frequently by intervals
approximating decades. Stallybrass calls attention to the
epidemic years in England, which are 1789–90, 1802–03, 1830–32,
1840–41, 1848–49 and 1851, 1854, 1869–70, 1879, 1890–91, 1898, and
1918–19. With the exception of 1854 all of these dates are around the
end of a decennium.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet, again, in the successive waves of an individual epidemic, as
has been pointed out by Pearl, there is very roughly some periodicity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Are these admittedly obvious phenomena fundamental features of
the life cycle of the influenza virus, or are they incidental, due to
extrinsic causes, changes in the pabulum, in the host as an individual,
or in the host as a community, or changes in climatic conditions? Is
it a basic feature upon which we must build our conception of the
epidemiology of epidemic influenza, or is it more a feature of chance?
The evidence to date is conflicting and incomplete. The answer lies
in the future.</p>

<p class='c007'>Periodicity in the acute infections is not a new subject. It has
been discussed in various other diseases, particularly in measles. For
many years epidemiologists in many parts of the world have reported
the observation of a periodicity in epidemics of measles. It is generally
regarded as an established fact that each locality suffers from
epidemic waves of this disease and that the period is somewhere about
two years. In certain relatively small localities in England where
registration statistics have been kept for many years the Health
Officers count on an epidemic every two years. In some places the
epidemic is expected to fall during the even years, while in others it
occurs in the odd years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Brownlee has been one of the foremost investigators in the periodicity
of influenza, but since his communication on that subject was very
brief, we take occasion to quote first from his article on the periodicity
of measles, thereby gaining a more comprehensive knowledge of his
theory, and at the same time becoming able to compare the periodicity
in the two diseases.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The common explanation of the periodicity of epidemics of children’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>diseases is that the susceptible children take the disease in
sufficient numbers to limit the further spread. The epidemic thus
dies out to recur when a further sufficient number of susceptible
children have accumulated. This is quite a feasible theory and certainly
explains the periodicity of epidemics. The forms of epidemic
curve which arise on this hypothesis are not unlike those actually
found, the differences being no more than might be expected between a
mathematical form based on a hypothesis and the natural conditions
to which the hypothesis is only an approximation. This explanation,
however, must fail if epidemics of different periods can be shown to
exist in the same town at the same time, and I think this has been
shown. In London, which on account of its size might be assumed
deserving of special treatment, the existence of periods of different
length have been demonstrated. In Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Birmingham
also it has been shown that epidemics with periods in the
neighborhood of ninety-eight weeks and one hundred and ten weeks
intermix. The same epidemicity even applies to districts in London.
In the West end of London we have almost a replica of what occurs in
Glasgow, Birmingham and Edinburgh. The main period there is 97
weeks, the secondary period 109.5 weeks. In the South of London
one period is that of 97 weeks, but almost equally prominent is that of
87 weeks. The whole evidence, therefore, seems to point to some condition
in the organism which produces the disease as the potent cause
of the difference rather than to the number of susceptible children.
Compare the <i>Paramoecium</i> which under natural conditions divides
asexually for several hundred times and then dies out unless conjugation
takes place. The resting stage following conjugation persists
for some time.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is, however, one point of great importance which must be
considered. If an epidemic begin in a definite locality and spread
from that locality, and if there is no loss of infectivity on the part of
the organism, it is demonstrable that a similar proportion of the population
should be attacked in each zone as the epidemic spreads outward.
On the other hand, if the organism lose the power of infecting
with the lapse of time, in each additional zone invaded the proportion
of susceptible persons infected should become smaller and smaller.
Of course this might not be true for any one epidemic, as in many
parts of the area invaded the population might be more or less susceptible
because of recent attack of the disease, but when an average of
twenty outbreaks has been taken this effect should be eliminated, the
number of times the invading organism comes into contact with an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>insusceptible population being balanced by the number of times which
it meets one more susceptible than the average. The method of
spread of epidemics on the average should thus give some indication
regarding the laws which determine the course of the phenomenon.
Now with regard to London, the clearest facts refer to the 87-weeks, the
97-weeks and the 109.5-weeks period. The 97-weeks period starts
at the same time all over the city and there is no evidence of any
special center. The infection seems generalized. With regard to the
87-weeks epidemic, however, the case is different. This seems to
start in St. Saviour’s Parish and to spread thence to Camberwell,
Lambeth, etc. In this epidemic the rate of spread can be definitely
measured. The maximum occurs later and later as the distance from
the center is increased and the percentage of children infected is also
easily observed to fall as the time increases. With regard to the 109.5 weeks’
period epidemic the facts are similar though not quite so
definite. This seems to show that for at least two strains of organisms
the epidemic ceases because the organism has lost its power of infecting.
It may be inferred that an epidemic ceases because the organism
varies in its potency to cause infection. A cycle of epidemics now
coinciding and now differing in their maxima can thus be explained.
Some kind of life cycle exists in the infecting organism. In this life
cycle high powers of infecting are attained probably after a resting
state: a period of activity follows and gives place to a period of rest;
the average length of the cycle is determined by the strain of the
organism.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There are certain drawbacks to Brownlee’s work and conclusions.
We quote from V. C. Vaughan, who has discussed Brownlee’s work,
not only because of his good summary of the difficulties and disadvantages
of the method, but particularly because the same disadvantages
and possibility of inaccurate conclusions hold in the case
of influenza.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is no reason for supposing that the virus of measles is controlled
in any way by our calendar. In order to get anywhere in
determining any law of periodicity in epidemics we must know the
morbidity and mortality of the disease by days, or at least by weeks.
In different parts of a large city there may be, and undoubtedly are,
epidemic waves of measles on the flow or on the ebb at the same time.
The best work that has been done along this line is that of Brownlee,
who has figured out epidemic waves of measles, based on the weekly
numbers of deaths in London between 1840 and 1912.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The figures presented by Brownlee are of great value, and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>theory is fascinating and has much in its favor, not only in a study of
epidemics of measles, but of the other infectious diseases of infancy
and childhood, especially scarlet fever, whooping cough, and chicken-pox.
In order to solve the problem of periodicity in measles we must
have more exact information than we now possess. Brownlee’s
figures pertain to deaths only. There are, so far as we know, nowhere
in the world satisfactory statistics concerning morbidity in this disease.
Deaths from measles are so largely determined by the care bestowed
upon the sick and upon the extent to which secondary infection is
prevented that we are inclined to hesitate about the acceptance of
a death rate or number of deaths from this disease as an index to the
virulence of the organism causing the disease; in other words, we are
not convinced that the death rate in a given outbreak of this disease
is a measure of the virulence of the organism causing it. This involves
the question whether measles <i>per se</i> is a disease of wide variation in
malignancy or are the widely different death rates observed in different
epidemics due to secondary infections. The streptococcus, a common
invader of the body during the progress of a measles infection, is known
to possess a most variable degree of malignancy. We are inclined to
the opinion that if all cases of measles could be recognized before
secondary infection occurs and could be cared for ideally the death
rate from this disease in different epidemics would be much more
uniform than is now shown and would be low. The greatest danger
to life in an attack of measles lies in the fact that the virus lowers the
resistance of the body cells and opens gateways to more deadly organisms,
such as the streptococcus. We believe that there are
demonstrated facts which support these ideas. Quite uniformly in
measles there is a well marked leukopenia. As we now interpret it,
this means a decrease in the number of the forces that naturally protect
the body against the invasion of foreign cells. Again as we interpret
it, the failure of the body cells to respond to the tuberculin test during
a course of measles or soon thereafter is evidence that the resistance
of the body is lowered. If our interpretation on these points be
correct we fail to see how deaths from measles can be properly employed
as a standard in the measurement of the virulence of the
organism of the disease.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Recognizing then the obvious disadvantages of the method, we will
turn to the work done on periodicity in influenza. We should call
attention at this point to the fact that the establishment of periodicity
would carry with it the assumption that the third of our three hypotheses
concerning the origin of influenza is the correct one. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>example, the July and autumn epidemic in England, as well as all
occurring subsequent to them, would be due to a virus or several
viruses which have been endemic in England since 1889, in fact since
man has been in England, and the epidemics and their recurrences
would be due to increase in the virulence of this local virus. The virus
is distributed over the earth and may become virulent periodically
in many countries at the same time, or if the periodicity is different
on two continents the epidemics would occur at different times.</p>

<p class='c007'>Periodicity is not a new hypothesis. Hirsch denied any periodicity
distinct enough to be revealed by the comparatively crude statistical
methods of his time. Periodicity if present can only be revealed by
detailed and complicated mathematical procedures. Brownlee has
investigated the weekly number of deaths from influenza in London
between 1889 and 1896, and also up to the present time. He has
compared these with the weekly number of deaths from bronchitis
and pneumonia in London, the records of which have been available
since 1870. By the method of the periodogram he showed that there
was a regular periodicity of 33 weeks in deaths from influenza between
the years 1889 and 1896, but that in later years there was some considerable
aberration. He concluded that for some reason influenza
periods tend to recur at 33-week intervals after the primary epidemic,
and that the favorable season for its recurrence is from January to the
end of May. Should the 33d week fall in other than these winter
months the epidemic may be mild or even missed, appearing after
another 33-week interval. Epidemic influenza does not assume a form
which causes any large number of deaths until a bronchitic or pneumonic
constitution has been established. The fatal form is usually a
disease of the winter or spring. He also found that in the absence of
influenza, bronchitis and pneumonia did not show a 33-week periodicity,
but when associated with influenza these conditions also became
periodic (33 weeks), and he assumes that this change is definitely
associated with the appearance of influenza.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between 1876 and 1890 there was no tendency to the 33-week
periodicity with regard to bronchitis and pneumonia, but it was very
marked between 1889 and 1896. During this epidemic period the
deaths from pneumonia precede those from influenza by one week and
those of bronchitis precede those of influenza by two weeks. The
number of deaths from bronchitis and pneumonia ascertained by this
method of grouping is fully twice the number obtained from influenza
alone.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>He believes that in these years, influenza appeared, on its epidemic
onset, first with bronchitic symptoms, later with pneumonic symptoms,
and lastly with those symptoms more definitely associated with influenza
proper. When the several sets of deaths are added together in
33-week periods a very typical epidemic makes its appearance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Brownlee finds that in the monthly statistics of Glasgow, Aberdeen,
Massachusetts, etc., there has been nothing differing essentially from
this phenomenon found in London.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between 1876 and 1889 the annual curve for bronchitis and pneumonia
shows two maxima, one at the end of January and the second
in the middle of March. From March the decline in deaths from
bronchitis is very rapid. The disease re-appears around the beginning
of October. During the period 1889–96 the maximum number of
deaths from bronchitis occurred in the second week of January and the
last week of February. Both of these maxima are a fortnight before
the maxima of the epidemics of influenza. This suggests that the
advent of influenza has brought a change in the seasonal prevalence of
bronchitis and supports the view that the earlier portion of the influenza
epidemic is associated with bronchitic symptoms. The same
phenomenon holds for pneumonia.</p>

<p class='c007'>Brownlee was able to predict correctly the date of the recent 1920
epidemic. He did not attempt, however, to explain the short interval
between the summer and autumn, 1918, epidemics in England. He
speaks of the second as “aberrant.” In other words, it does not fall
within his classification. October is not a high respiratory disease
month. The epidemic should have been mild.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stallybrass has confirmed Brownlee’s 33-week periodicity and suggests
an explanation for the “aberrant” October epidemic. Using
periodograms with a 33-week basis, and plotting deaths from influenza
and respiratory diseases from January, 1890, through January, 1920,
he finds that the most definite 33-week periodicity is shown during the
years 1890–99. During this period there is one maximum, when all
33-week periods are superimposed, which occurs at the seventh week
of the cycle. Beginning about 1899 a new maximum appears in the
nineteenth week of the cycle, which continues to recur until the
culminating point is reached in the week ending October 26, 1918.
An additional 66 weeks carries the date forward to the first week in
February, 1920. The maximum at the seventh week of the periodogram
during the years 1899–1913 is greatly diminished from that in
1890–98. The periodogram for 1914–1919 shows clearly both maxima,
that in the seventh and that in the nineteenth weeks.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>We quote Stallybrass in some detail (see Chart XII):</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dr. John Brownlee pointed out that from July 13th to March 1st
(the maxima of the summer wave of 1918 and of the spring wave of
1919) is 33 weeks, but that the wave having its crest in this country
on November 2, 1918, does not fall into the sequence, leaving one to
infer that there were two strains of the influenzal virus in operation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I supplement his investigation by the weekly deaths occurring in
Liverpool during the period 1890–1919 that were ascribed to influenza
and to all respiratory diseases. Prior to 1890 there were no deaths
attributed to influenza for a number of years.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Closely corresponding with Brownlee’s observations on London
by far the most definite periodicity is shown during the years 1890–1899,
during which period there is one well marked maximumly at the
seventh week of the cycle. During the period 1899–1913 a new maximum
in the nineteenth week of the cycle comes into play and continues
to recur until the culminating point is reached in the week ending
October 26, 1918, a week earlier than in most English towns (Wave
III); a further 66 weeks carries one forward to the first week in February
of this year, as Brownlee pointed out, and the outbreaks that
are being reported in Japan, Paris, Chicago, New York, etc., would
show that this strain has punctually reappeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is also evidence in the table of a small maximum at the
twenty-seventh week of the cycle in the earlier sub-period, and at
the twenty-ninth week in the later sub-period; slight movements of the
maxima forwards or backwards in the cycle over a number of years
may, perhaps, indicate a periodicity slightly greater or less than 33
weeks. The twenty-ninth week of the cycle fell on the weeks ending
May 18, 1918, and January 10, 1919. An examination of the figures
in Dr. Hope’s annual report for Liverpool for 1918 shows that there
was a definite wave of influenza reaching its crest on May 18th (Wave
I), and there is also a definite rise in the deaths from influenza, respiratory
diseases, and from all causes, making a small peak in the week
ending January 3, 1919, but it is hidden by the enormous waves of
October and March, so that it only appears as an irregularity in the
curve; but it was noted at the time that influenza had not declined
in Liverpool in January in the way that it had in practically all other
English towns. These two waves do not appear to have played a
large part in this country, but the outbreaks in the Grand Fleet in
May, 1918, and also in Spain, Glasgow, etc., may, perhaps, be attributed
to it. In the United States in January, 1919, it would appear
to have played a much larger part. In a large number of American
cities two waves are experienced, the first being the October wave;
the crest of the second wave sometimes fell in March, as did one of the
crests in this country, but in a number of instances, <i>e.g.</i>, Cambridge,
Washington, San Francisco, New Orleans, etc., it fell in January, or to
be exact, in the thirty-first and thirty-second weeks of the cycle.
The close relationship of Liverpool and Glasgow with the United States
through the incoming stream of American troops may perhaps account
for the presence of this May wave in these two towns, and not the
rest of England.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>“The third maximum in the fourth week of the cycle is represented
during the late outbreak by the waves culminating in Liverpool, and
also the greater number of English towns on the weeks ending July
13 (Wave II) and March 1 (Wave IV). This is a 33-week interval.
This wave recurred at an interval of 32–34 weeks in a large number of
English towns.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of 65 towns which experienced all three waves 47 (72 per cent.)
had their maxima in the summer and spring epidemics within an
interval of 32–34 weeks; but comparing the week in which any given
town had its epidemic peak in the summer and autumn, and autumn
and spring epidemics only 27 (41 per cent.) and 31 (47 per cent.)
respectively fell within the limit of a week on either side. The time
relationships of the maxima in summer and spring were much closer
to each other than they were to the autumn maxima.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If it should prove correct that there were three strains of the
influenzal virus, each with a periodicity of about 33 weeks, and that
simultaneously all three strains became enhanced in both virulence
and infectivity, then we are faced with a phenomenon without an
exact parallel, although the behavior of the meningococcal viruses
during the war presents some points of similarity. So far the weight
of evidence leans to such an exaltation of a widespread endemic strain
or strains rather than to dissemination from any particular focus in
the world. In any case doubtless a good deal of spread of infection
took place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Spear takes exception to the work of Brownlee and Stallybrass, and
points out that the periodogram is not applicable to the study of
recurrent epidemics unless the recurring waves are of approximately
uniform “amplitude.” In that case nothing could be less appropriate
for this study than the influenza waves which vary from very small to
extremely high, as in 1918.</p>

<p class='c007'>Spear describes two simple tests which he applied to demonstrate
the existence or non-existence of periodicity.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>First he divided each of the last thirty years into 13 four-weekly
periods, and tabulated the frequency with which the observed week of
maximum mortality falls into one or other of the 13 groups. He
discovered that the climax of an influenza prevalence falls more
frequently in the second and third four-weekly period than in others—<i>i.e.</i>,
the months of February and March. Had there been a 33-week
periodicity there would have been an equal number of these climaxes
in each of the 13 divisions of the year.</p>

<p class='c007'>Brownlee, according to Spear, was correct in his prediction that
influenza would occur in February, 1920, for the reason that January
or February is the most likely time for an influenza prevalence in any
year.</p>

<p class='c007'>Spear’s second test of periodicity consisted in plotting the interepidemic
periods according to the number of weeks intervening. Were
there a 33-week periodicity, he says, that nearly all interepidemic
periods should fall in this group. As a matter of fact, more than twice
as many periods fall in the 42–58 weeks interval than in any other
interval. Fifteen fall within this period, six in the period 59–75 weeks,
five in the period 8–24 weeks, and only four in the period 25–41 weeks.
There was one in the period 76–92 and one 110 plus. Finally in the
thirty years 1890–1919 there were thirty-two climaxes or peaks in the
“influenza” mortality.</p>

<p class='c007'>Spear concludes that if there is any periodicity it is around fifty
weeks, or a year.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fallacy in the work of Stallybrass and of Brownlee, according
to him, is that the mortality in the third week of 1892, the twentieth
week of 1891, and the tenth week of 1895, and in the big epidemic of
1918 so overshadowed all the other peaks that the smaller ones became
lost in these larger waves.</p>

<p class='c007'>Brownlee does not claim a 33-week periodicity during interepidemic
periods. This part of Spear’s criticism is not valid.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vaughan’s objections to the conclusions on measles hold equally
well with regard to influenza. Finally, we must remember that in
parts, at least, of the work of Brownlee and Stallybrass, they are not
studying chiefly influenza deaths, but deaths reported as due to
bronchitis and pneumonia.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a study of the pros and cons of the question of periodicity
the author submits by way of summary his conclusions:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Influenza does tend to recur at intervals. It has not been
proven that these intervals are always of equal length.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. At the present the opinions concerning the periods are divergent.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>We have the 33-week periodicity of Brownlee and Stallybrass,
the one-year period of Spear, the seven-week intervals suggested by
Pearl, and the apparent twelve-week recurrences in England in 1918
and 1919.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. It is to be noted that particularly in the work of Stallybrass, in
order to prove his periodicity, he finds it necessary at times to quote
epidemics occurring, not in England, but in fairly remote parts of the
world, as in the United States and Japan. We have shown that in the
interval between 1918 and 1920 an epidemic could be discovered
somewhere on the earth in many months, perhaps even in every
month during this interval. It is to be regretted that following the
criticism by Spear there has been no further report, so far as we know,
by either Brownlee or Stallybrass.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. It is quite possible, even probable, that influenza is endemic in
mild form throughout the interpandemic years in England, as well as
in many, or all other countries, but it is equally possible or probable
that the particular virus which gave rise to the pandemic was not one
which simultaneously increased in virulence in all countries, but was
one which had its origin in one comparatively well localized focus.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. Our own theory does not explain the autumn recurrence in 1918
in England, following that of May, June and July. We have traced
the original spread to England and have left it at that point. We
have again taken it up in the autumn when it became severe, and was
returned to the United States. The interval of quiescence in England
and elsewhere may need further explanation. Two alternative
hypotheses suggest themselves: First, that the autumn recrudescence
is entirely comparable to later ones, and is but a manifestation of the
characteristic feature of recurrence in influenza. Had the autumn
epidemic been mild and had it not so overshadowed all others, we
would have classified it with those of early 1919 as being merely
recrudescences of the summer spread. Evidence, particularly in
favor of this, is the report of Greenwood previously mentioned which
shows that in England the autumn spread partook of the nature of a
secondary type of epidemic, as compared with the primary type in
the summer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second hypothesis is that the occurrence in the summer in
England of an epidemic due to a virus imported from America or
France or China, with its consequent increase in morbidity, so
enhanced the virulence of a local endemic British virus that the latter
produced the autumn epidemic. We see no necessity for complicating
the question by the assumption of this second hypothesis.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>6. Whether or not there is a regular periodicity of a definite
number of weeks in the case of influenza, the fact remains beyond
cavil that one of the dominant characteristics of epidemic influenza
is its recurrence at intervals. The evidence is ample that the disease
is distributed throughout many countries in interepidemic times and
that intermittent outbreaks of large or small extent occur.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most striking phenomenon is the fact that in March of 1918
influenza is reported as having been present in China, in the United
States and in France. It is scarcely possible that the disease in its
epidemic form could have been carried from any one of these three
points to the other two in the remarkably short time between the
onset of the three outbreaks. We are faced with the phenomenon of a
simultaneous exaltation of the influenza virus in three remotely
separated countries of the world. This one fact more than any other
indicates that the fluctuation in virulence is dependent upon some
factor intrinsic in the virus itself and not upon environmental factors.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is impossible at the present time to decide whether the world
epidemic spread simultaneously from these three foci or whether in
only one of these three the virus became so exalted as to produce
pandemic prevalence. All we can say is that we are able to trace
consecutively the spread of the influenza from the focus in the United
States throughout the world. The information upon which we base
our findings is not statistical, and as we have previously said this
latter type of demographic study should be brought into use to either
corroborate or disprove our findings.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Virulence Enhancement.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>Before attempting to study the mechanism of origin of the 1918
pandemic it is highly essential that we devote some attention to a
consideration of the processes by which the germs of infection, particularly
the virus of influenza, may develop an increase in virulence.
Followers of the theory of periodicity would base virulence enhancement
primarily on some intrinsic property of the virus itself. We
know from past experience and particularly from animal experiments
that this is not the only manner by which virulence may be increased.</p>

<p class='c007'>As far as we know there is no new infectious disease. Individuals
who delve into the history of the past inform us of more and more
diseases which were well known to the ancients. We are frequently
amazed at the variety of diseases now known to be infectious that were
very correctly described by the Hippocratic writers. The infectious
diseases are with us always and live nearly always in man, the host.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>There are few exceptions. Very few of the contagious viruses can
live for any long period of time outside of the human body. A few,
such as the plague bacillus, may live on other hosts, but these are the
exception. The remarkable feature is that for long periods of time
the virus exists in the host in a quiescent state and only at intervals
does it become highly invasive and thereby produces epidemics of
greater or less extent. Under what conditions does the metamorphosis
of the microorganisms occur?</p>

<p class='c007'>Topley, in the Goulstonian lectures, discusses this subject. He
says: “The first difficulty with which we were faced in forming any
theory of the spread of bacterial infection, which should conform to
the known facts of epidemiology, was to find some explanation of the
perpetuation of the virus during interepidemic periods. The bacteriologic
data which have accumulated, especially during the last twenty
years, have shown that the causative agents of specific diseases are to
be found in apparently normal persons who give no history of having
been in contact with the disease in question, as well as in contact with
actual cases of the disease. Moreover, the organisms in question
have been shown, in certain cases, to persist for long periods of time
in or upon the tissues of their hosts, and we must always remember that
the difficulty of bacteriologic technic is likely to lead to a serious
under-estimate. Clinical and epidemiologic investigations have
yielded confirmatory evidence, and we are thus left with a conception
of the virus of a given disease being distributed fairly widely throughout
the world as an apparently harmless parasite on the human host,
but taking on during epidemic periods a new and sinister role, only to
relapse again into comparative quiescence as the epidemic subsides.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He explains the rise of the epidemic wave as follows: “There are
at least three possible explanations—an increase in the power of the
parasite to produce disease, a decrease in the resistance of the host,
and some attraction in the surrounding circumstances which favor the
transference of parasites from case to case without any alteration of
the pathogenicity of the one or in the resistance of the other. The
third of these hypotheses may, I think, be disregarded. That alterations
in environment may be the determining cause in initiating an
outbreak of bacterial disease is probable enough; but they will almost
certainly act through the variations which they bring about in the
other two factors. The whole of bacteriologic knowledge is clearly
against the occurrence of a considerable epidemic in which the pathogenicity
of the parasite and the resistance of the host remain constant.
Again, while we may well believe a lowered resistance of a certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>number of the host-species to be an important factor in the initiation
of the process, yet we cannot believe that it is the whole story.
The widespread ravages of many epidemics would seem altogether to
preclude such an explanation. We seem forced therefore to the conclusion
that an increase in the pathogenicity of the specific parasite
is an essential factor in the rise of epidemics, excluding from this
category small sporadic outbreaks which may be due to the introduction
of a fully virulent parasite by a healthy carrier in some other way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>If a disease like measles is quiescent in a given community it must
be that in that locality the hosts and parasites are existing in a state of
biological equilibrium. They are living in a state somewhat akin to
symbiosis. Such a condition could be attained either by a diminution
of the invasive powers of the parasite, or by an increase in resistance
of the host. Probably both elements are active; as the relative immunity
of the host rises the infectivity or virulence of the parasite
must rise to an equal extent to maintain the equilibrium. If this were
true we would find that in those localities in which the disease is endemic
and where the population is relatively resistant there is a normally
more virulent virus in existence. A stranger coming into such a
community would, in view of his lower resistance to the virus, be
more susceptible of becoming actively infected. There would, however,
be little danger of an epidemic spread because the number of
susceptibles would, roughly, be limited to the number of strangers
in the community. If, however, an individual from the community
carrying the more virulent virus were to travel to another community
where the greater proportion of the population was relatively less
immune the field would be fertile for the beginning of an epidemic.
Furthermore, there is the possibility of an outbreak in the first community
if there should occur gross changes in its constitution; another
infectious disease, a redistribution of the population with greater
crowding, anything to change the balance between host and parasite.</p>

<p class='c007'>Theobald Smith has described this possibility very clearly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“During the elimination of the more virulent races of microorganisms,
there goes on as well a gradual weeding out of the most susceptible
hosts. In a state of nature in which medical science plays no part,
there must occur a slight rise in the resistance of individuals, due to
selection and perhaps acquired immunity, which meets the decline
of virulence on the part of microbes until a certain norm or equilibrium
between the two has been established. The equilibrium is different
for every different species of microorganism, and is disturbed by any
changes affecting the condition of the host or the means of transmission
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>of the parasite. One result of the operation of this law is the low
mortality of endemic as compared with epidemic diseases. Certain
animal diseases while confined to the enzootic territory, cause only
occasional, sporadic disease, but as soon as they are carried beyond
this territory epizootics of high mortality may result. Climate in
some cases enters as an important factor, but the most important,
perhaps, is the slight elevation in virulence brought about by a more
highly resistant host. The most susceptible animals are weeded out
and the rest strengthened by non-fatal attacks. The virulence of the
microbe rises slightly to maintain the equilibrium. In passing into
a hitherto unmolested territory, the disease rises to the level of an
epizootic until an equilibrium has been established.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The same is true of human diseases, among which smallpox is a
conspicuous example. The great pandemics of influenza, which seem
to travel from east to west every one or two decades, soon give
away to sporadic cases, and the careful work of many bacteriologists
would indicate that the influenza bacilli found at present have fallen
to the level of secondary invaders, and are parasites of the respiratory
tract in many affections.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Smith describes his hypothesis that the tendency of microbes in
perfecting the parasitic habit is to act solely on the defensive. The
aim of microorganisms, if we may speak of such, is to become able to
live unharmed on the host. If they kill the host they have lost their
home. The biologic tendency would be in this case for diseases which
were once acute to become more and more chronic and indolent.</p>

<p class='c007'>The extremely virulent parasite, which kills its host, will die
with the host unless it has effected a means of exit before its death
and escapes into a new host. For this reason Pasteur failed to exterminate
the rabbits of Australia. He believed that with races of
the bacillus of rabbit septicemia, which were very virulent, and which
destroyed life very quickly, all that would be necessary was to start
the disease among the rabbits of Australia and that it would tend to
spread and would kill off all of the rabbits. But the parasite killed
the animals before it had perfected for itself a means of escape from
the body and thereupon died.</p>

<p class='c007'>“From the biologic standpoint which I have endeavored to present,
we may conceive of all highly pathogenic bacteria as incompletely
adapted parasites, or parasites which have escaped from their customary
environment into another in which they are struggling to adapt
themselves, and to establish some equilibrium between themselves
and their host. The less complete the adaptation, the more virulent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>the disease produced. The final outcome is a harmless parasitism or
some well-established disease of little or no fatality, unless other
parasites complicate the invasion. The logical inference to be drawn
from the theory of a slowly progressive parasitism would be that in
the long run mortality from infectious diseases would be greatly
reduced through the operation of natural causes. But morbidity
would not be diminished, possibly greatly increased by the wider and
wider diffusion of these parasites, or potential disease producers. The
few still highly mortal plagues would eventually settle down to sporadic
infections or else disappear wholly because of adverse conditions to
which they cannot adapt themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In this mutual adaptation of microorganism to host, there is,
however, nothing to hinder a rise in virulence in place of the gradual
decline if proper conditions exist. In fact, it is not very difficult to
furnish adequate explanations for the recrudescence and activities of
many diseases today, though the natural tendencies are toward a
decline in virulence. In the more or less rapid changes in our environment
due to industrial and social movements the natural equilibrium
between host and parasite established for a given climate, locality,
and race or nationality is often seriously disturbed and epidemics of
hitherto sporadic diseases result.</p>

<p class='c007'>“These illustrations indicate that so-called natural law does not
stand in the way of our having highly virulent types of disease, if we
are ignorant enough to cultivate them. The microorganism is sufficiently
plastic to shape itself for an upward as well as a downward
movement. Among the most formidable of the obstacles toward a
steady decline of mortality is the continual movement of individuals
and masses from one part of the world to another, whereby the partly
adapted parasites become planted as it were into new soil and the
original equilibrium destroyed. These various races of disease germs
become widely disseminated by so-called germ carriers, and epidemics
here and there light up their unseen paths.”</p>

<p class='c007'>An example of increasing virulence from changing environmental
conditions, is the experience in the United States Army camps in 1917
and 1918 with the streptococcus. This microorganism, which at first
was but a secondary invader, particularly to measles, became so
exalted in virulence that it soon became the cause of primary disease.
This is likewise true of the various secondary invaders of the influenza
epidemics. They become so highly virulent that they dominate the
picture in the later stages. The organisms included in this group are
particularly the streptococcus, the various pneumococci, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>meningococcus. Probably the tubercle bacillus should be added to
this list.</p>

<p class='c007'>It requires a certain amount of time for such organisms to
attain increased virulence. The earliest cases in any epidemic are
comparatively very mild. Thus Major Billings, epidemiologist at
Camp Custer, says that for the first five days of the autumn influenza
epidemic in that camp the cases admitted to the hospital were very mild
in character and were recorded as simple bronchitis and pharyngitis, of
no great severity, the majority soon recovering. Five days after the
first case was admitted, however, the entire symptom complex seemed
to change, and the cases admitted to the hospital from then on were a
very different and much more severe type. Major Billings, after
going over the records, feels that both types of cases were the same
disease, the second being a more severe form. Woolley reports
essentially the same condition from Camp Devens.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same phenomena were found in 1889. During the 1889 epidemic
Prudden examined by current bacteriologic methods seven
cases of influenza and six cases of influenza-pneumonia. In them he
found staphylococcus pyogenes aureus, streptococcus pyogenes,
diplococcus pneumoniae, and in other cases he found a streptococcus.
He concludes that the use of culture methods and media commonly
employed has brought to light no living germ which there is reason to
believe has anything to do with causing the disease. He emphasizes
the probable importance of streptococcus pyogenes in particular in
inducing the various complications.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this point we should include for the sake of completeness reference
to a recent theory propounded by Sahli explaining influenza
epidemics, a theory to which we do not subscribe. He believes that
the pneumococcus, the streptococcus, the influenza bacillus, and
possibly other organisms, form a complex group, an obligate complex,
a symbiosis, a higher unit, which infects the organism as a unit. It is
all of these organisms acting together which produce the influenza.
After infection has occurred one or the other member of the group may
develop preferentially. In favor of this he says that in one of his
cases the sputum was swarming with influenza bacilli on one day, and
that the next day the sputum was a thick pure culture of the pneumococcus.
He says that if an ultramicroscopic germ should yet be discovered
this would not invalidate the theory, but would merely add
another member to the group forming the obligate complex virus unit.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Meteorologic conditions.</i>—Formerly attempts were made to
demonstrate etiologic relationships between the occurrence of influenza
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>and unusual conditions of the atmosphere. In most cases no
relationship has been discovered. Nevertheless it is conceivable that
the changes in the atmosphere, particularly seasonal variations, might
influence the virulence of the organism. It has been found that nearly
all of the many epidemics apparently originating in Russia took their
origin there either in the late autumn or in the winter months. The
spread of influenza appears to be uninfluenced by atmospheric conditions,
but the severity of the disease is definitely increased in the winter
months, and Leichtenstern believes that the development of a primary
spread from its point of origin is also influenced by the season. Hirsch
found that out of 175 correlated pandemics or epidemics, 50 occurred
in the winter between December and February, 85 in the spring from
March to May, 16 in the summer from June to August and 24 in the
autumn.</p>

<p class='c007'>The soil plays no part in the spread of the disease. It prevails
on every soil or geologic formation; on the mountain top, in the low
malarial swamps, in the tropics and within the arctic circle. Volcanic
eruptions, fogs, electrical conditions, ozone, direction of the wind,
have all been considered in previous epidemics and successively
eliminated as etiologic factors.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must be stated, however, that Teissier, who investigated the
influenza in Russia in 1890 and has compared his conclusions at that
time with the results of investigation of the recent visitation, believes
that some particular cosmic conditions suddenly enhanced the virulence
of an endemic etiologic microorganism—probably some ordinary
germ—and that this opened the portals to secondary infections.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Secondary invaders.</i>—We have considered a possible manner in
which the virulence of the organism causing influenza may become
enhanced. Whatever this organism may be, another and equally
important virulence enhancement occurs in the opportunist group of
the germs, so-called secondary invaders of influenza. As we have
previously remarked, it is a characteristic of influenza outbreaks in all
communities that the earliest cases are very mild. Secondary infection
has not as yet obtained a foothold. After about a week the character
of the illness changes, becoming distinctly more severe. Billings
reported that at Camp Custer in the autumn of 1918 cases admitted
to the hospital during the first five days were very mild in character and
were reported as simply bronchitis or pharyngitis of no great severity,
the majority soon recovering. After this time the entire symptom complex
seemed to change and the cases admitted to the hospital
were of a very different and more severe type.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Benjafield reports that in the Egyptian Expeditionary Force the
epidemic commenced in May, 1918, and that the cases occurring
during the earlier portion of the epidemic were mild in type and of
short duration, only a very small proportion being complicated by
bronchopneumonia. Wooley found at Camp Devens that the first
cases were of a mild form and were usually diagnosed “naso-pharyngitis,
acute catarrhal.” After a few days the disease became more
severe and pneumonia cases developed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Bezançon found that among the repatriated French soldiers from
Switzerland those cases occurring in May and June had a much lower
severity than in the later epidemic. Zinsser’s description of the mild,
earlier epidemic in Chaumont has already been quoted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The secondary invaders of pathogenic importance are the various
forms of the streptococcus and pneumococcus, the meningococcus, the
staphylococcus, and probably the tubercle bacillus and the influenza
bacillus. In the last epidemic as in that of thirty years previously,
the chief complications were bronchitis and pneumonia. Capps and
Moody found these to be the chief complications in December, 1915.
Also they found a high incidence of sinusitis. This has been a feature
of the last epidemic. Wooley cites a good example of the damage done
by these opportunist organisms when they are present. Among the
troops stationed at Camp Devens in the fall of 1918 pneumonia following
influenza was particularly prevalent in a battalion of negroes from
the South. This battalion had, a short time previously, passed
through an epidemic of pneumonia and Wooley believes that many of
the blacks were harboring the pneumococci which were only awaiting
a favorable opportunity to invade their hosts. The influenza furnished
the required opportunity.</p>

<p class='c007'>That the meningococcus should be classed in this group is certain.
The author observed at Camp Sevier cases of epidemic meningitis
occurring in various influenza wards scattered throughout the hospital,
with no demonstrable relationship. Usually there was but one case in
a ward and almost invariably meningitis occurred when convalescence
was beginning. No epidemic occurred in any ward. Others have
reported actual epidemics of meningitis following influenza. Moss
found that a large proportion of his influenza cases had the meningococcus
in the circulating blood, as demonstrated by culture. Fletcher
cultivated meningococci from the lungs in all of eleven autopsies, and
in all eleven cases the influenza bacillus was also present.</p>

<p class='c007'>In considering the effect of influenza on the death rate in general,
and in considering the relationship of influenza to other diseases in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>general, it is important to distinguish those diseases which are apparently
unrelated and those diseases which occur as direct complications
or sequelae. Bronchopneumonia, bronchitis, empyema, otitis media,
frequently tonsillitis and sometimes erysipelas, occur as sequelae.
Meningitis should frequently be included in this group.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not only is there an increase in certain other diseases following
influenza outbreaks, genetically related, as we have seen, but also
some observers, particularly Crookshank, believe that previous to
epidemic influenza prevalences there occurs an increase in the incidence
of other entirely unrelated infectious diseases, such as poliomyelitis.
This theory of simultaneous increase in invasiveness of many apparently
unrelated germs is comparatively new and will probably receive
deep consideration in the future. For the present the information on
the subject is so limited that attempted conclusions would have no
value.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Origin of the 1918 Pandemic.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>In discussing the spread of the 1918 pandemic over the earth, the
author has traced it from an apparent origin in the United States.
Localized early epidemics are reported simultaneously in the United
States, France, and China. From the literature at his disposal he has
been unable to find convincing proof of an earlier origin in Asia, but
he did emphasize at the time the necessity of a much more thorough
study of influenza in all countries to be made by more competent
statisticians. Nevertheless it is highly interesting to formulate an
hypothesis which appears to meet all demands, on the assumption
that the disease originated in America. In order to hold a theory
with this basis we must assume that the third of our previously mentioned
hypotheses of the origin of the disease is the more nearly correct.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let us assume that in the interpandemic periods the influenza virus
is widely distributed over the earth, existing in an avirulent form.
The basis for this assumption is the previously described occurrence
of localized epidemics in interpandemic periods. The occurrence of
solitary cases, although of interest, could scarcely be considered as
evidence of the widespread distribution of the virus, but in the case of
the small outbreaks as in 1900, 1907 and 1915, and as in the numerous
small outbreaks described by Hirsch, the character of the epidemic
curve is characteristic. Let us, then, assume that the disease has
been endemic in the United States, together with other localities.
It requires no keen observation to discover in the years 1917 and 1918,
Theobald Smith’s “movement of individuals and masses from one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>part of the world to another, whereby the partly adapted parasites
become planted, as it were, into new soil, and the original equilibrium
is disturbed.” Not only was there a tremendous redistribution and
concentration of individuals in our camps in this country, but also
there was a further disturbance of the equilibrium in the outbreak
of other infectious diseases, particularly measles. The effect of the
measles epidemic on the virulence of the streptococcus and allied
organisms has been discussed; presumably the same occurred with
respect to the influenza virus. Howard and Love report that approximately
40,512 cases of influenza were reported in the United States
Army during 1917. They write:</p>

<p class='c007'>“In 1917, the death rate for the acute respiratory diseases (influenza,
pneumonias and the common types) increased to 1.71. During
the fall of 1917, after the camps were filled with drafted men, acute
epidemic diseases swept through a number of them. Measles was one
of the most prevalent and one of the most fatal of the infectious diseases
that occurred. It was noted during the fall and early winter that
there were a number of cases of pneumonia which were unlike the
pneumonia that ordinarily occurred. This was apparent both to the
physicians in civil life and in the army camps. It was reported by all
classes of practitioners that numerous cases of pneumonia were occurring
which resembled the pneumonia following measles, but occurring
among men who had not had measles recently. In a number of the
camps, both in the north and in the south, rather extensive epidemics
of pneumonia occurred and a number of deaths resulted. The same
variety of pneumonia occurred in the late winter and spring of 1918.
In many of the camps pneumonia was practically epidemic during
March and April. In many camps a number of cases occurred later
in the spring and summer. It was again reported by a number of
medical men that these cases of pneumonia that were occurring were
different from the types of pneumonia ordinarily encountered and very
similar to pneumonia following measles, but, again, that the cases
occurred among men who had not had measles recently.”</p>

<p class='c007'>MacNeal has observed similar conditions in the American Expeditionary
Forces in France in 1917:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The American troops in France in 1917 began to show, as early as
October, 1917, a very considerable rise in the influenza morbidity.
The data available in the office of the Chief Surgeon, A. E. F., show
an influenza morbidity per 100,000 of 321 in July, 438 in August, and
404 in September, rising to 1,050 in October, 1,980 in November,
and 2,480 in December, 1917, in which month the total number of new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>cases of influenza reported was 3,520. That a considerable proportion
of these cases were actual infections with the bacillus of Pfeiffer
is proven by the necropsy findings in fatal cases of bronchitis and
bronchopneumonia, especially those performed by Major H. E.
Robertson at Army Laboratory No. 1, Neufchateau, in November and
December, 1917, and January, 1918. In these cases the bacillus of
Pfeiffer was found in the scattered patches of lung involved in the
bronchopneumonia and also with great frequency in the cranial sinuses.
These necropsy findings were, at the time, recognized as essentially
new for young adult Americans, and, in a discussion at Army Laboratory
No. 1, during December, 1917, they were considered as being of
possible important significance for the future morbidity of American
soldiers in France. In the British Army in France there is definite
evidence of epidemics showing the same pathologic condition, during
the winter of 1916–17, and at Aldershot in September, 1917. There
can be little, if any doubt that this disease was essentially the same
which attacked the American soldiers late in 1917.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Schittenhelm and Schlecht have reported that a disease was
studied among the German troops on the Eastern front which resembled
greatly the influenza. It occurred from the beginning of August to the
middle of October, 1917. It attacked simultaneously and in epidemic
form units and divisions very widely separated over a large territory.
It was characterized clinically by a very sudden onset, in the greater
number of cases with chill, headache, pain in the extremities, sometimes
thoracic pain and cough. The fever lasted seven to nine days.
The spleen was enlarged in 11 per cent. of the individuals. There
was diarrhea in 12 per cent., frequently conjunctivitis, and quite
often a scarlatiniform rash. Bacteriologic examination of the blood
was negative. There was usually leucopenia. No treatment seemed
especially efficacious. Aspirin gave the best results. The authors
call attention to the close similarity to influenza and also suggest that
it might have been due to transmission by insects as in pappataci
fever or in dengue.</p>

<p class='c007'>Carnwath concluded that the finding of influenza bacilli in necropsies
in British soldiers in 1917 was without epidemiologic significance in
considering the origin of the 1918 pandemic. He had studied the
disease among the British in detail and appeared to be of the opinion
that the first influenza morbidity of significance among the British
troops did not appear previous to April, 1918.</p>

<p class='c007'>MacNeal further says: “The influenza rates per 100,000 of 1,050
in November and 2,480 in December, 1917, really indicate a greater
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>relative prevalence of influenza at that time in the A. E. F. than
occurred in the fall of 1918, when the respective morbidity rates were
826 in September, 2,176 in October, and 1,356 in November. The
total number of American troops in France was relatively small during
that winter—141,995 effective mean strength in December—so that
the prevalence of influenza did not lead to the recognition of an actual
epidemic. Furthermore, the overcrowding in quarters, which seems
to have had a definite relation to many of the later explosive outbreaks,
had not become such a distinct feature at that time. In addition, the
cold, wet weather, exposure and unusual living conditions furnished
explanations for the morbidity which were no longer adequate during
the hot weather of May and June, 1918. Until May, 1918, therefore,
the prevalence was that of an endemic disease, with perhaps an occasional
outbreak suggesting epidemic character.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We admit that MacNeal’s report furnishes excellent evidence of an
independent origin in France. Two points should be borne in mind.
First, that MacNeal’s figures are not for the French, but for the
Americans who were transported to that country, and that we may
consequently consider influenza among the American Expeditionary
Forces as being possibly from the same source as influenza among the
troops in our own country,—that the American Expeditionary Forces
may be considered a subdivision of the American Army in the United
States, equally well as a subdivision of the French population; second,
that we have been unable to find detailed evidence of similar conditions
occurring among the French troops or French population, where the
conditions have been ripe in a way since 1914. MacNeal records
that in March and April, 1918, there was a great increase in the number
of troops brought over from the United States to France. Previous
to that time there had been 287,000 in that country and during the two
months 150,000 were added, with a consequent increase of more than
fifty per cent.</p>

<p class='c007'>We should insert a word of caution regarding the diagnosis of
influenza among troops in the absence of any sign of an epidemic.
Internists who served in base hospitals during the war will agree that a
diagnosis of influenza is very frequently made on the admission card
when the disease turns out to be some other malady. This was not
equally true in all camps, but regimental surgeons could often be
found who would transfer a patient to the hospital with the diagnosis
of influenza used almost interchangeably with the diagnosis “Fever
of unknown origin.” It would be interesting to see statistics from one
or two of those base hospitals which were manned with especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>competent internists, as to the frequency with which the admission
diagnosis of influenza remained unchallenged in the hospital, during the
year 1917.</p>

<p class='c007'>There would be such cases in greater or smaller numbers. The
magnitude of this number would not influence our hypothesis.</p>

<p class='c007'>Aside from this discussion of the disease among our troops in France
it is most important that we establish, if possible, the identity of the
disease reported among British troops in Northern France during the
winter of 1916–1917 and designated by the name “Purulent Bronchitis.”
The disease first appeared in December, 1916. It reached its
height during February and early March of 1917, and appears to have
disappeared early in the spring. Hammond, Rolland and Shore
report that during February and early March 45 per cent. of the necropsies
under observation showed the presence of purulent bronchitis,
and they remarked that the disease assumed such proportions as to
constitute almost a small epidemic. They described the clinical
aspects as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The cases which came under our notice can be divided broadly
into two types: The first and more acute presents a clinical picture
which closely simulates ordinary lobar pneumonia with a sustained
temperature of about 103°, and expectoration at first blood-streaked—rather
than rusty—which, however, rapidly becomes quite purulent.
The pulse-rate in these cases is out of all proportion to the temperature
in its rapidity. Dyspnoea and cyanosis are prominent features. The
patient usually dies from ‘lung block,’ resulting in embarrassment of
the right side of the heart on the fifth or sixth day. For the last day
or two there is often incontinence of the feces, due, no doubt, to the
condition of partial asphyxia. The mental state is one of torpor;
delirium is the exception.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The second and less acute type is marked by a more swinging temperature
with a range of two or three degrees. The expectoration at
first may be frothy and mucopurulent, but it very soon assumes the
typically purulent character. This form may run a long course of
from three to six weeks, during which time the patient wastes a great
deal and has frequent and profuse sweats; indeed, at a certain stage
the illness is most suggestive of acute tubercular infection, and it is
only by repeated examination of the expectoration that the clinician
can satisfy himself he is not really over-looking a case of acute pulmonary
tuberculosis. The majority of our cases conforming to this
type have ultimately recovered, but the convalescence is slow and
tedious.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>“Onset.—Whilst a history of a previous catarrhal condition lasting
for a few days is often obtained, the disease quickly assumes an acute
character; we have been able to observe this in patients admitted into
this hospital with purulent bronchitis; we find the temperature is
between 102° and 103°, the pulse 120 or over, and the respiration about
35. The patient frequently complains of shivering and looks pathetically
miserable, but we have not seen an actual rigor. Despite his
obvious shortness of breath, the sisters have noticed that, at any rate
at first, he prefers a lateral position low down in the bed, and resents
any attempt to prop him up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cough.—This for the first day or two may be irritable and distressing,
with a little frothy expectoration, but as the latter becomes
more purulent the cough is less troublesome, and soon the patient is
expectorating easily and frequently, until the later stages are reached;
when owing to increasing asphyxia the patient becomes more and more
torpid, the cough subsides, and hardly any secretion is brought up.
This failure becomes an added factor in bringing about a rapidly fatal
termination.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Expectoration.—The sputum, with its yellowish-green purulent
masses, is very characteristic, and may be one of the first indications
of the serious nature of the illness the patient is suffering from.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Temperature.—The fever of this complaint does not follow any
very constant type. In nearly all our cases the pyrexia was of sudden
onset, and for the first few days was more or less sustained at about
103°. Later it conformed more to the swinging type with a range of
several degrees. In a few cases a curious gradual ante mortem drop
has been observed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pulse.—Tachycardia is a very constant feature throughout the
illness. The rate is frequently well over 120, though the volume may
remain surprisingly good until immediately before death.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Some degree of dyspnoea is always present, and is usually progressive,
though towards the end in the fatal cases when the mental
acuteness is dulled by the increasing asphyxia the patient is not distressed
by its presence. In some cases there have been paroxysmal
exacerbations of the breathlessness, accompanied by a state of panic,
in which the patient struggles wildly and tries to get out of bed in
order to gain relief. Cyanosis is another prominent feature throughout
the illness. At first it may not be more than duskiness, but in the
later stages it becomes very evident. It is only slightly relieved by
oxygen; this, no doubt, is partly explained by the difficulty in giving
the oxygen efficiently, owing to the patient’s objection to any mouthpiece
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>that fits at all tightly, and partly by the blocked condition of
the bronchioles interfering with the absorption of the oxygen.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The condition usually begins with the presence of a moderate
number of sharp crepitant râles, often first heard in the region of the
root of the lung; these quickly become generalized. In the majority
of the cases signs of bronchopneumonia patches can be made out;
these are generally situated near the root of the lungs. In a certain
number of cases these patches spread and become confluent, giving
practically all of the physical signs of a lobar pneumonia. As the
disease progresses the air entry is diminished; on listening one is often
struck by the small volume of sound heard. The resonance of the
lungs may also be lessened. A slight pleuritic rub was heard in a few
of our cases, but this was soon masked by the bronchitis signs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Detailed sputum examination in twenty cases showed the presence
of the influenza bacillus in eighteen, and in ten out of these eighteen
the organism was isolated by culture. The next most frequent organism
found was the pneumococcus, which was present in thirteen
cases. The streptococcus was found in five.</p>

<p class='c007'>Abrahams, Hallows, Eyre and French report the same epidemic:</p>

<p class='c007'>“A typical case is as follows. The onset is usually acute; the
early symptoms are those of a ‘cold in the head.’ The temperature
may be 101 or 102°, but there are no features to distinguish the condition
from acute ‘coryza’ or febricula, so that in the majority of cases
the patient does not report sick for two or three days, by which time
he is sent to the hospital. At this state two features attract particular
attention. First, the character of the expectoration: this consists of
thick pale yellow, almost pure pus, not the frothy expectoration familiar
in ordinary bronchitis; it has no particular odor and it becomes
increasingly abundant until in a day or two it may amount to several
ounces in the twenty-four hours. Secondly, the rapidity of the
patient’s breathing: this may be so evident that pneumonia suggests
itself, yet on examining the chest the only physical signs consist of few
or many rhonchi scattered widely, but most marked at the bases of
the lungs behind, associated with a wheezy vesicular murmur; resonance
everywhere is unimpaired and bronchial breathing is absent. A
little later a third point attracts notice; a peculiar dusky heliotrope
type of cyanosis of the face, lips, and ears, so characteristic as to
hall-mark the nature of the patient’s malady even on superficial
inspection. By this time dyspnoea is very pronounced; respiration
consists of short, shallow movements, which in bad cases amount
almost to gasps, reminiscent of the effects of gas poisoning. Recovery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>at this stage may occur, but by the time the cyanosis has become at all
pronounced the prognosis is extremely bad, though the number of
days the patient may still live, in spite of the severity of his distress,
is often surprising. The character of the sputum remains the same
throughout, though sometimes it is blood-tinged or actual blood may
be expectorated instead of, or in addition to, the more typical pale
yellow pus. In the later stages of the illness areas of impaired note or
of actual dullness may be found, particularly over the posterior aspects
of the lungs, associated with bronchial breathing and crepitant râles.
These may be due to the progression of the purulent bronchitis into
hypostatic pneumonia, or into actual bronchopneumonia at the bases;
or, on the other hand, they may be due to massive collapse of the lungs
secondary to the bronchitis and obstruction of the bronchioles by pus.
In a few cases, not necessarily the most serious, a frank lobar pneumonia
has developed later, and has been followed by an empyema
from which 15–30 ounces of thin pneumococcal pus has been aspirated—in
one case alone was resection of a rib unavoidable. The condition,
however, is not primarily a lobar or a bronchopneumonia, but a
bronchitis, and although a small amount of basal bronchopneumonia
has been present in one or two of our post-mortem examinations, in
other fatal cases there has been no bronchopneumonia at all, not even
the smallest portions of either lung being found to sink in water.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We have no doubt that the condition is primarily an affection of
the bronchi and bronchioles, and not of the alveoli, though the alveoli
may be affected later if the patient survives long enough. In a
typical post-mortem examination it would be difficult, or almost impossible,
to define the actual cause of death unless one knew the clinical
history.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Abrahams and his collaborators describe in detail eight consecutive
cases. A study of the type of onset may be of help in determining the
character of the disease. The first patient had been subject to bronchitis
for years. He had been ill with cough and some pyrexia for
five days previous to his admission. There is no further description
of his admission symptoms. Case two was admitted on March 17th,
having taken ill the previous day with shivering, cold and pain in the
chest. The temperature was 104°, the pulse-rate 118, and the respirations
were 44. The patient was very restless and had much dyspnoea
but was not cyanosed. The third patient had taken ill three days
previous to admission with symptoms of cold in the head and a sore
throat. He complained of headache and dry cough without expectoration,
shortness of breath, and a pain behind the sternum.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>Case four was admitted with a history of having been out of sorts
with a cold and bronchial cough for ten days previously. On admission
his temperature was 103°, pulse-rate 112 and respiration-rate 36. He
had abundant blood-stained purulent sputum.</p>

<p class='c007'>Case five is the first case that shows a type of onset distinctly
resembling that of influenza. The patient had been ill three days with
headache, cough and generalized pain previous to his admission. The
temperature on admission to the hospital was 103°, pulse-rate 112,
respiration-rate 20. There were no abnormal physical signs in the
chest on admission. They did appear two days later. Case six
related that he had been sleeping under canvas for three nights before
coming to the hospital, and that during the first of these nights he was
taken ill with a cold which became associated with a cough and increasing
shortness of breath. On admission there was slight cyanosis,
and dyspnoea was very pronounced. Shortly afterwards he became
orthopnoeic, with heliotrope cyanosis. On the slightest exertion, such
as turning over in bed, the cyanosis increased markedly, and although
the respiration-rate remained under forty when he was at rest, on
the least exertion it increased to nearly sixty. The sputum was
purulent and abundant, pale yellow, not frothy and not blood-stained,
and the day after admission contained Bacillus influenzae, pneumococcus
and Micrococcus catarrhalis.</p>

<p class='c007'>Case seven had been ill seven days before admission with cough and
fever. On admission his temperature was 105°, pulse 116, respiration
24. Case eight gave a history of having had a cough for eight days
previous to admission. This cough had not incapacitated him much
at first, but he became progressively worse during the four days before
admission, with increasing shortness of breath and abundant yellow
sputum which he found it difficult to raise. On admission dyspnoea
with cyanosis was very evident.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even from these detailed clinical descriptions it is impossible to
say definitely whether the disease was or was not influenza. There is
no doubt, however, but that clinically the disease resembled more the
so-called streptococcus pneumonias that were observed in the United
States camps in the winter of 1917–18. The descriptions of the mode
of onset are particularly at variance with the onset as we know it
in influenza.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those who believe that the influenza bacillus is the cause of influenza
maintain that the finding of this organism in a large per cent. of
cases by both groups of observers is valuable evidence. For reasons
previously stated we cannot agree.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Description of the epidemic features is not detailed enough to be
of assistance. The first group of authors remark that the disease
constituted “almost a small epidemic.” The second group say that
six out of eight cases in their series of candidly reported patients came
from one command. The former report on twenty cases, the latter
on eight. The latter remark that although they have dealt with only
eight cases in detail, they had a much larger number altogether.
Presumably there were a decidedly larger number of patients in both
hospitals, but the actual number is not stated. In short, we do not
know whether the disease appeared to be more or less epidemic than
the apparently similar disease among our troops in the winter of
1917–18.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both groups of observers have described in some detail the pathology
of the cases which were necropsied. The author in attempting
to obtain further comparative information has submitted the pathologic
descriptions given by the British authors to Dr. E. W. Goodpasture,
who has very kindly pointed out the points of similarity and difference
between the gross and microscopic findings in these cases of purulent
bronchitis, and the same findings in typical influenza. He says that
the lung picture, as described, is not the same as that which was
typical of the acute influenza observed in the autumn of 1918 and
again in the winter of 1920. The characteristic picture in the latter
is primarily an extensive involvement of the alveolar structure, while
as Abrahams and his associates remarked, the condition in their case
is primarily “an affection of the bronchi and bronchioles, and not of
the alveoli, though the alveoli may be affected later, if the patient
survives long enough.” Goodpasture states that the pathology as
described by the British authors is very similar to the lung picture in
interstitial bronchopneumonia described by MacCallum for the post-measles
and primary bronchopneumonia among our troops in the
winter of 1917–18. The streptococcus and the influenza bacillus were
dominant organisms in MacCallum’s series. It also resembles the
pathologic picture described by Pfeiffer in his original article on one of
the late recurrences of the 1889–93 epidemics of influenza.</p>

<p class='c007'>In summing up, we must admit that it is impossible to reach a
definite conclusion, but that both clinically and pathologically the
disease described among the British troops in 1916 and 1917 was not
typical of influenza as we have known it more recently. The similar
conclusion reached by Carnwath, presumably chiefly from epidemiologic
considerations, has already been described. We do not deny
that this “purulent bronchitis” <i>may</i> have been influenza. On the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>contrary, it is a part of our hypothesis that influenza under the proper
conditions may become epidemic in practically any land. But
we do believe that the evidence has not shown that the disease among
the British troops in 1916 and 1917 was an etiologic precursor of the
great pandemic.</p>

<p class='c007'>To return to a discussion of influenza in China, we quote from an
article by Cadbury in the China Medical Journal: “Unfortunately no
health reports are available for the greater part of the Chinese Republic.
We have consulted, however, the Health Reports of the Shanghai
Municipal Council from 1898 to 1917, and among the total foreign
deaths we find that only the following were attributed to influenza:
1899, one death; 1900, one death; 1907, four deaths; 1910, one death.
After this no deaths are recorded from this cause up to and including
the year 1917.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In the Hongkong Medical and Sanitary Reports, which give the
total deaths registered in the Colony, we have examined the records
from 1909 to 1917. During these nine years only two deaths were
attributed to influenza, and both occurred in 1909.</p>

<p class='c007'>“From a personal letter from Dr. Arthur Stanley, Health Officer in
Shanghai, dated February 11, 1919, I quote the following:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘As to influenza we had an attack beginning at the end of May and
lasting through June and again in the latter part of October and lasting
through November. The latter was somewhat more severe. The
noteworthy features were general absence of catarrhal symptoms,
congestive pharynx frequent, as also was a slight erythematous blush
on the neck and chest, which made one think at first of scarlet fever.
Fatal pneumonia common among the Chinese and Japanese, but
among Europeans very little pneumonia.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“In his report for May, 1918, Dr. Stanley says that the disease was
reported to have reached Peking before it came to Shanghai, but subsequent
reports showed that most of the river ports were almost simultaneously
infected, the rate of spread conforming to the rate of conveyance
by railways and boats of infected persons. The mortality
was very low.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Newspaper reports indicate that a third appearance of the disease
in Shanghai occurred from the middle of February, 1919, which was
still prevalent in April. The symptoms were much more severe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For Hongkong I quote from a personal letter from Dr. Hickling,
the Principal Medical Officer of Health, dated January 29, 1919:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘The epidemic of influenza in the spring was a very mild one, so
far as we can judge. The disease did not last more than a few days in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>most cases. The recent epidemic (October, November, December and
January) has been much more severe, often lasting two or three weeks.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“Only one death, which occurred on May 14th, was reported from
Hongkong in the spring. In the later epidemic the deaths reported
were as follows: October, 70; November, 95; December, 67. The
first of these deaths occurred on October 5th. The figures for January
had not been compiled, but the disease was diminishing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dr. C. W. McKenny of Hongkong has kindly furnished me with
the following facts: ‘During the first five months of 1918 there were
twenty-two admissions for influenza to the Civil and Tung Wa hospitals
(3 in May). In June there were 269 cases with three deaths. In
July, August and September, 43 cases; and during October-November,
130 cases with four deaths....</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘The June epidemic in Canton appeared first at the Pui Ying
School, then among the employees of the Post Office, the staff of the
Canton Hospital, the Canton Christian College, and the Kung Yee
Hospital. The other schools entirely escaped. Eleven days were
taken by the disease to spread from one part of the city to the various
other parts.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>Plague appeared in the north of China in 1917, originating apparently
in inner Mongolia. The spread extended over quite an area,
and it is reported that this epidemic of pneumonic plague has been
more extensive than any since that of 1910–11. The disease was
first reported prevalent in Patsebolong December 6, 1917. The
diagnosis was confirmed bacteriologically, and there can be little
doubt but that the cases of plague reported in various parts of China
even up to March 18th were true plague, and not unrecognized
influenza.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>SECTION III.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In the following section of our report we shall have frequent
occasion to refer to a series of investigations conducted by the author
in the City of Boston during the 1920 influenza epidemic. We will
explain in some detail at this point the nature of the work done and the
methods used, in order that the subsequent references will be readily
intelligible.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>An Investigation of Influenza in Boston During the Winter of 1920.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>Following every widespread epidemic interest centers in the question
as to how much havoc the disease has wrought, what proportion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>of the population fell victim, and how many of these died. With
regard to influenza the vital statistics of all countries are decidedly
insufficient in furnishing this information.</p>

<p class='c007'>In nearly all countries influenza is not a reportable disease.
Usually, as was the case in the United States in 1918, the disease was
made reportable during the epidemic, but this took effect usually at
least two weeks after the epidemic had started in a community.
Further, there is probably not a single community in which the reported
cases of influenza reach to anywhere near the total of actual cases.
The question of diagnosis, which is not always easy even in the presence
of a pandemic, causes some physicians to hesitate to report cases.
Other physicians “play safe” and report nearly everything as influenza.
Finally, in the period of an epidemic, the physicians are so pressed
with caring for the sick that they very naturally neglect to report cases
as they occur.</p>

<p class='c007'>It becomes necessary, therefore, in collecting evidence in civil
populations, of the morbidity and fatality from influenza, to obtain
additional information to that available to the Health Officer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The method which may be relied upon to give the most accurate
data consists in house-to-house surveys made soon after an epidemic,
in which competent inspectors obtain detailed information concerning
the illness or freedom from illness of every individual in the areas
canvassed. The majority of individuals interviewed will not have
had the disease, and it is therefore essential that in such a census a
large enough population be covered that the resulting figures will be
truly representative of the population at large.</p>

<p class='c007'>Toward the end of January, 1920, when the recurrent epidemic was
at its height in Boston, the author undertook with the aid of thirteen
trained social service workers, and one physician, who was a graduate
of the Harvard School of Public Health, to make a sickness census of
10,000 individuals. Six districts were chosen in different sections of the
city, representing six different economic and social groups. Great
care was exercised in selecting the districts, so that the population in
each might be as homogeneous as possible regarding economic and
sanitary status, as well as race, and living conditions in general.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have sought to clarify and to abbreviate our description of the
characteristics of the various districts by incorporating a map, together
with photographs of typical streets in each district. One who
compares these streets as they are seen in the photographs would
scarcely find it necessary to enter the buildings in order to discover
the living conditions of the occupants (Chart XIII).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>District I includes an Italian population of 2,000 individuals,
one-half of which live in the most congested portion of the city (see

East Boston, are slightly less crowded.</p>

<p class='c007'>District II, in South Boston, consists of 2,000 individuals almost
entirely of Irish race stock.</p>

<p class='c007'>District III, like District I, consists of three groups living in very
similar environment to the two groups of the first district, but composed
chiefly of Jewish race stock of various nationalities. The
photograph for this district represents the area in the “West Side”
near the Charles River Basin. The area in the “South End” is of
similar type, while the area in East Boston is housed similarly to the
Italian district in East Boston. The dwellings in both of these latter
districts correspond to those shown in the second photograph of
District II.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the first three districts comprise tenement areas, some poor
and the remainder very poor, Districts IV and V represent the middle
class, and consist nearly entirely of “Duplex” and “Three-Decker”
buildings. The first of these comprises 1,000 individuals of mixed
race and nationality, the type broadly spoken of as American. The
second consists of a Jewish population of 1,600.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>In District VI are included 1,400 individuals belonging to the well-to-do
and moderately wealthy families of Brookline.</p>

<p class='c007'>The six districts may be considered as representative of the various
strata of society, so that we are enabled to study the influenza and
its mode of action under varying environment. We have selected
areas in the city consisting of households or homes rather than boarding
houses and rooming populations. After a few attempts in the latter
group we became convinced that the information obtained in rooming
houses was utterly valueless. In the Jewish districts we were able,
through the kind co-operation of the Federated Jewish Charities, to
use trained Jewish Social Service Workers, each of whom had previously
worked in the district assigned to her, thereby possessing the confidence
of the inhabitants. They were also able to speak the language.
One-half of the Italian district was surveyed by an Italian physician
and the other half by an American Social Service Worker who knew
the Italian language.</p>

<p class='c007'>The information obtained was recorded on printed forms, which
were filled out in accordance with detailed written instructions. Form
“A” contained the necessary information concerning the family as a
whole, including statistical data of each individual, description of the
dwelling, of the sanitary condition, of the economic status, etc. Form
“B” was filled out for each individual and gave detailed information
as to the occupation and illnesses during the 1918–19 or the 1920 influenza
epidemics, or during the interval. Form “B” was so arranged
that the inspector was not called upon to make the diagnosis of influenza,
but to record the various symptoms as described by the patient.
The decision as to the diagnosis was made later, by the author. All
blank spaces were filled in with either a positive or negative answer,
so that the reviewer knew that all questions had been asked and
answered. (See Appendix.)</p>

<p class='c007'>The inspection was begun on February 9th, at the height of the
epidemic. All records were turned in and reviewed by the author,
who blue-penciled obvious inaccuracies and incorporated directions
and questions in those instances where he desired further information.
The records were then returned to the inspectors who, at the termination
of the epidemic early in March, surveyed the entire 10,000 a
second time, checking up their first record, correcting any inaccuracies,
and adding records of additional cases of influenza which had occurred
in the interval.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most careful statistical surveys and compilations are not without
error. We have gone into considerable detail in the preceding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>description in order to demonstrate the several checks that have been
made upon the work, without which information others would be
unable to judge of the accuracy or value of our work.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Diagnostic standards for the 1918 epidemic.</i>—All cases of illness
recorded on the reports, which have occurred during either the 1918 or
the 1920 epidemics, or in the interval between them, have been put
into four groups as regards diagnosis of influenza. Cases are designated
as “Yes,” “Probable,” “Doubtful,” and “No.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Cases of illness occurring during the months of 1918 and 1919 in
which influenza was epidemic and in which the patient remembers
that he had the more definite symptoms, (fever, headache, backache,
pain in the extremities, pneumonia) and in which he was sick at least
three days and in bed at least one day, have been designated as “Yes.”
The symptoms chosen are those most likely to be remembered. The
individual frequently does not remember all. Statements of the
absence of fever are often unreliable. Usually the headache, backache
or pain in the extremities, or even all of these are well recollected.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cases occurring particularly during the epidemic period in which
the more definite symptoms are unknown, but who were sick three
days or longer and who were in bed at least one day, were probably
influenza. This is particularly true if there were no other symptoms
suggestive of some other definite disease. Such cases were designated
“Probable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Cases have been designated as doubtful when the evidence of
illness falls short of the above desiderata. Cases of true influenza
may fall into this group, either because of the extreme mildness of the
symptoms and course or because of the inaccurate memory of the
individual concerning the events of his illness sixteen months previously.
Our results show that the group of doubtful cases is relatively
very small and the number of true cases lost in this group will be
negligible.</p>

<p class='c007'>One important reason for adhering to the above classification is
that it corresponds closely with that used by Frost and Sydenstricker,
so that our results may easily be compared with theirs.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Standards for 1920.</i>—For 1920 the illnesses were so recent in the
minds of the patients that we have required rather full information
for making the diagnosis of “Yes.” For this designation certain
symptoms are arbitrarily required. Certain additional symptoms,
if present, serve to strengthen the diagnosis of influenza. The required
symptoms are fever, confinement to bed for one day or more and at
least two out of the following three, headache, backache and pain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>in the extremities. The additional symptoms which influence the
classification are sudden onset, prostration, lachrymation, epistaxis,
and cough.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cases designated as probable are those in which the symptoms as
enumerated above are incomplete in one or more details, but yet in
which the diagnosis of influenza would be justified. “Probable,”
therefore, means that the case is to be accepted among the list of true
influenza cases. This is particularly so when the case occurs during
the epidemic period.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Doubtful” applies to those cases in which the evidence although
suggestive of influenza, is not complete enough to warrant such a
diagnosis. The doubtful feature may be in the lack of too great a
number of the symptoms enumerated, or the presence of symptoms
which might be due to some other disease. Certain cases occurring
at the same time with other cases of typical influenza in the same
household, and which would otherwise have been recorded as
doubtful, have been marked either “Probable” or “Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Standards of severity.</i>—A purely arbitrary classification of severity
has been adopted. Probably no two observers would agree exactly
on a classification of this nature, but for the purposes of this study the
following will suit all requirements provided the standard used is
carried in mind throughout the comparison.</p>

<p class='c007'>If a patient with influenza is under medical care, and the case is one
of ordinary severity, the usual period in which the individual is advised
to remain in bed is one week. This is the basis of the criteria of
severity.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Mild.</i>—A case is recorded as mild if the individual has remained
in bed three days or less; <i>Average</i>, if in bed four to seven days; <i>Severe</i>, if
in bed over seven days. <i>Pneumonia.</i> This designation is added to
that of “severe” only in case the physician made such a diagnosis,
or if the evidence under “symptomatology” leaves no doubt as to the
condition.</p>

<p class='c007'>Examples of individual exceptions to the preceding general classification
are as follows: An individual in bed two days, but sick for
three weeks might be recorded as average. A mother, with a family
of sick children and who spent no time in bed may have been a severe
case of influenza. In fact, we have allowed ourselves a certain latitude
in individual cases in classifying both the diagnosis and the severity
of the disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the final tabulation we have included both the “Yes” and the
“Probable” as being cases of influenza. This has been done after a
careful comparison of both groups.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>As a check upon the reliability of the work we have compared our
results for the 1918 epidemic with those reported by Frost and Sydenstricker
and have discovered that with regard to the general subject
discussed in both studies there is close agreement. This is important
in view of the long period that has elapsed between the first pandemic
and the time of our survey, and because we are unable to compare
our tables of incidence for 1918 with those for the city or the state at
large. Our own records do not place the date of occurrence of the
disease in 1918 any more closely than by month.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have compared our 1920 incidence curves with those of Massachusetts
and find a close correspondence, particularly in the date of
onset, peak, and disappearance of the epidemic. We have done
likewise for the occurrence of the disease in the city of Boston at
large (Chart XIV).</p>

<p class='c007'>In the past but few house-to-house canvasses have been made
with relation to influenza. Auerbach, following the 1889 epidemic,
collected statistics on 200 families distributed throughout the city
of Cologne. Abbott, while not conducting a canvass, did obtain a
certain amount of valuable information by letters addressed to
physicians, institutions and corporations throughout the State of
Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is fairly abundant literature on the disease as it occurred in
institutions. Moody and Capps, in a study of the epidemic in Chicago
in December, 1915 and January, 1916, made a survey of the personnel
and inmates of four institutions in that city. Among other rather
numerous statistical compilations from institutions we may mention
that of Hamilton and Leonard which was devoted particularly to
a study of immunity, and that of Stanley at San Quentin Prison,
California.</p>

<p class='c007'>Garvie has reported his personal experience with influenza in an
industrial area and discusses the disease as it has occurred in families
in his private practice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Carnwath reports a “block census” undertaken by Dr. Niven in
Manchester, England. This is of the same nature as our own work.
Reeks has made a detailed house survey of 2,757 persons in New
Britain, Connecticut. D. W. Baker has conducted somewhat similar
surveys for the New York Department of Health, and Winslow and
Rogers quote the excellent record of the Visiting Nurse Association
of New Haven, in which they have information for all of the families
cared for by the nurses. This, however, is a collected group and does
not correspond with the so-called block census.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>The most comprehensive and detailed work that has been done in
this line is that reported by Frost and Sydenstricker and by Frost,
the first being the result of a canvass of 46,535 persons in Maryland,

several different cities of the United States. We shall have occasion

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Morbidity.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>There has been great actual variation in the morbidity from influenza
in the various epidemics and even in different localities during
single epidemics. Previous to 1889 there were no reliable statistics
for the disease incidence, and subsequent to that date the records,
for the reasons previously mentioned, have still been not entirely
adequate.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the history of influenza morbidity, as in that of its mortality,
we must content ourselves for information prior to the nineteenth
century with the very general estimates made by contemporary
historians. During the last century the statistics have been more
numerous and more nearly correct. As far back as the first recognized
pandemic, 1510, the extremely high morbidity has been a recognized
characteristic. Thomas Short in speaking of this pandemic says,
“The disease&#160;... attacked at once and raged all over Europe,
not missing a family and scarce a person.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Pasquier in 1557 spoke of the disease as common to all individuals,
and Valleriola describes the widespread distribution of the epidemic
throughout the whole of France during that year. It spared neither
sex, age, nor rank, neither children nor aged, rich nor poor. The
mortality, however, was low, “children only, dying.” Again, Thomas
Short remarks, “This disease seized most countries very suddenly
when it entered, catching thousands the same moment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the second pandemic, 1580, Short says, “Though all had it, few
died in these countries except such as were let blood of, or had unsound
viscera.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thomas Sydenham remarks that in the epidemic of 1675 no one
escaped, whatever might be his age or temperament, and the disease
ran throughout whole families at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>Molineux recorded concerning 1693, “All conditions of persons
were attacked, those residing in the country as well as those in the
city; those who lived in the fresh air and those who kept to their rooms;
those who were very strong and hardy were taken in the same manner
as the weak and spoiled; men, women and children, persons of all
ranks and stations in life, the youngest as well as the oldest.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Schrock tells us that in Augsburg in 1712 not a house was spared
by the disease. According to Waldschmidt in Kiel, ten and more
persons were frequently taken ill in one house, and Slevogt says that
the disease was fearful because so many persons contracted it at the
same time. The disease was, however, not dangerous, for Slevogt
continues: “Fear soon vanished when it was seen that although it
had spread all over the city, it left the sick with equal rapidity.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is estimated that in the epidemic of 1729–1730, 60,000 people
developed the disease in Rome, 50,000 in Mayence, and 14,000 in
Turin. In London “barely one per cent. escaped.” In Lausanne
one-half of the population, then estimated at 4,000, was stricken. In
Vienna over 60,000 persons were affected. In the monasteries of
Paris so many of the inmates were suffering from the disease that no
services could be held.</p>

<p class='c007'>Huxham is quoted in Thomson’s “Annals” as declaring concerning
the epidemic of 1732–33: “Not a house was free from it, the beggar’s
hut and the nobleman’s palace were alike subject to its attack, scarce
a person escaping either in town or country; old and young, strong and
infirm, shared the same fate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Finkler writes as follows concerning the epidemic of 1758: “On
Oct. 24th, Whytt continues, the pestilence began to abate. He is not
sure whether this was due to a change in the weather, or because the
disease had already attacked most people, although the latter seems
more plausible to him, particularly as he says that ‘in Edinburgh
and its vicinity not one out of six or seven escaped,’ and in other localities
it is said to have been even worse. In the north of Scotland also,
the epidemic was greatly disseminated from the middle of October to
the end of November. A young physician wrote to Robert Whytt:
‘It was the most universal epidemic I ever saw, and I am persuaded
that more people were seized with it than escaped.’ This same physician
reported that ‘it was not at all mortal here.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the epidemic of 1762, we learn from Razoux, de Brest, Saillant,
Ehrmann, that the morbidity was great while the mortality was low.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Grimm, nine-tenths of the inhabitants of Eisenach
contracted the disease in 1767.</p>

<p class='c007'>Daniel Rainy, of Dublin, in describing the invasion of an institution
in 1775–76, tells us that from among 367 persons varying in age
from 12 to 90 years, 200 were taken sick. Thomas Glass says:
“There sickened in Exeter Hospital all the inmates, one hundred and
seventy-three in number; one hundred and sixty-two had coughs.
Two or three days after the hospital was invaded the city workhouse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>was attacked; of the two hundred paupers housed there only very few
escaped the disease.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Gilibert described an extraordinary morbidity in Russia in 1780–81.</p>

<p class='c007'>Metzger says that in 1782 the Russian catarrh was so universal
during the month of March that in many houses all the inhabitants
were attacked. During this period, “in St. Petersburg, 30,000, and
in Königsberg, 1,000 persons fell ill each day;” in Rome two-thirds
of the inhabitants were attacked; in Munich, three-fourths; and in
Vienna the severity of the epidemic compelled the authorities to close
the theaters for eight days.</p>

<p class='c007'>The epidemics of 1788–89, 1799–1800 and of 1802–1803 were
characterized by a relatively lower morbidity than that of 1830–32, in
which the morbidity was again enormous. Likewise in 1833, the
morbidity was very great. In Prague “scarcely a house was spared
by the plague.” In Petrograd, 10,000 persons were attacked; in
Berlin at least 50,000. These are the figures of Hufeland. The
Gazette Médicale records the morbidity as being four-fifths of the total
number of inhabitants of Paris.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1836, according to Gluge, 40,000 persons suffered from the
disease in Berlin alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>In London, in the 1847 epidemic, it has been calculated that at
least 250,000 individuals took sick, and in Paris, according to Marc
d’Espine, between one-fourth and one-half of the population developed
the disease, and in Geneva not less than one-third.</p>

<p class='c007'>Leichtenstern informs us that in 1890 the early reports were made
by clinical men and were mere presumptions. They were almost
universally higher than the later statistical findings. The early estimates
for the morbidity in several German cities were from 40–50 per
cent. On the other hand, one of the highest statistical reports recorded
by Leichtenstern was for Strasbourg in which 36.5 per cent. of the
individuals became sick. The average morbidity reported by him ran
between 20 and 30 per cent. The difference is accounted for in part
by the fact that some of the very mild cases were not recorded in the
statistics, and in part by the tendency in giving estimates, to exaggerate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Auerbach has collected the statistics of 200 families distributed
throughout the city of Cologne. He found that 149 of these families
(75 per cent.) were attacked. In these, 235 were ill—59 men, 95
women, and 81 children. The larger number of women was explained
as due to the illness of the female servants. He estimates each family
as consisting on an average of six individuals, and concludes that 20
per cent. were taken with the disease.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Following the 1889 epidemic, Abbott concluded, on a basis of questionaires
sent out to various individuals and institutions in the State
of Massachusetts, that 39 per cent. of the entire population had been
attacked, in all about 850,000 persons.</p>

<p class='c007'>Moody and Capps, in December, 1915, and January, 1916, made a
survey of the personnel and inmates of four institutions in Chicago,
the Michael Reese Hospital, the Illinois Training School for Nurses,
the Old Men’s Home, and St. Luke’s Hospital Nurses Training School,
making a total of 677 persons surveyed, of whom 144 developed
influenza, making a percentage morbidity of 21. They remarked
that there were many others with colds who remained on duty and
were not included in the table and were not diagnosed as influenza.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have already described the relatively low morbidity and
mortality in the early spring epidemic in the United States. According
to Soper, the total number affected in March, 1918, at Camp
Forrest and the Reserve Officers Training Camp in the Oglethorpe
Camps was estimated at 2,900. The total strength at that time was
28,586. The percentage morbidity then was probably a little over
10 per cent. Dunlop, in describing the May, 1918, epidemic in Glasgow,
says that it was more limited in extent, as well as milder, than the
later epidemic.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been estimated that in the autumn epidemic in the United
States Army Camps one out of every four men had influenza, and one
out of every twenty-four men encamped in this country had pneumonia.
During the four autumn months of 1918, 338,343 cases of influenza
were reported to the Surgeon General’s Office; there were 61,691 cases
of pneumonia.</p>

<p class='c007'>Woolley reports that among the soldiers at Camp Devens, Mass.
30 per cent. of the population was affected.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Camp Humphreys, 16 per cent. of the entire personnel developed
the disease. The camp had an average strength of 26,600 individuals.
Fifty-two per cent. of the entire number of cases occurred during the
peak week, which ended October 4th. The outbreak began September
13th and ended October 18th.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hirsch and McKinney report that an epidemic of unusual virulence
swept with great rapidity through several organizations in Camp
Grant between September 21, 1918, and October 18, 1918. During
this time 9,037 patients were admitted to the Base Hospital, representing
about one-fourth of the strength of the camp, and of these,
26 per cent. developed pneumonia. About 11 per cent. of the total
admissions or 43 per cent. of the total cases of pneumonia died.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Referring to the report of Howard and Love, we quote as follows:
“It is probable that practically all susceptible human material in
infected camps suffered from an attack of the disease during the continuance
of the epidemic. The records from various camps indicate
that from 15 to 40 per cent. of commands suffered from an attack of
the disease. These records, as previously stated, do not indicate in
full the true incidence of the disease. Certain good results were
accomplished in some camps by the application of effective and early
isolation of patients and suspects and other measures generally recognized
as of value. It was sometimes possible to retard the progress of
the epidemic and cause it to be spread over a longer period of time.
The epidemic thus became less explosive in character, and fewer people
were under treatment at the same time. It was possible to take
better care of the sick and thus reduce the incidence of and deaths
from complicating pneumonia. It has not been shown that such
measures accomplished reduction in the absolute number of cases of
influenza occurring in one command as compared with another.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The ‘cantonment’ group of camps gave a much higher death rate
from influenza and its complications than the ‘tent’ camp or ‘departmental’
group. At first glance it would appear that the different housing
conditions and the more marked overcrowding in cantonments
at the time would fully account for this divergence. Closer study,
however, leads to the conclusion that geographical location was a
factor of equal or greater importance. It is well known that the
disease was most virulent and fatal in the northern, eastern and middle
west states, a district in which cantonments predominated. In the
southern and Pacific coast states, where the most of the tent camps
were located, a milder type of the disease prevailed, with fewer resultant
fatalities. Camp Lewis, Washington, and Camp Gordon, Georgia
(both cantonments), had relatively low death rates, approximating
those in nearby tent camps. On the other hand, Camp Syracuse,
New York, and Camp Colt, Pennsylvania (both tent camps), suffered
severely and reported death rates approximating those of cantonments
in the same geographical district.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Three waves of influenza are reported by Stanley at San Quentin
Prison. During the early wave it was estimated that over 500 of the
1,900 men in the prison population were ill. The wave lasted for a
little over two weeks. In the second epidemic there were 69 cases in
all, ten per cent. of which developed pneumonia, with two deaths.
There were fewer ambulatory cases than in the first. Three and
seven-tenths per cent. of the population was attacked in the second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>epidemic, as compared with 27 per cent. in the first. In the third
epidemic there were 59 cases, with no pneumonia and no deaths.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hernando estimates that in the Philippine Islands, 40 per cent. of
the total population of 7,000,000 was stricken with the disease. The
epidemic began in June, although it did not become severe until
October. The group of ages that suffered most were those between
ten and twenty-nine years. Hernando does not believe that the
disease was imported because cases were reported before ships arrived
from infected countries. After the importation of cases from elsewhere
the disease assumed the more severe form.</p>

<p class='c007'>Armstrong, in reporting a survey of 700 influenza convalescents in
Framingham, Mass., remarked that 16 per cent. of the entire population
were infected with influenza. Reeks, in a house survey in New
Britain, Connecticut, found from among 2,757 persons that the morbidity
rate reached 234 per thousand. Dr. Niven found in his block
census in Manchester, England, that of 4,721 individuals, 1,108
(25 per cent.) had developed the disease. Fourteen and eight-tenths
per cent. of the population were attacked in the summer and 10.4 per
cent. during the autumn and winter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frost found in his survey of 130,033 individuals that the percentage
of the population attacked varied from 15 per cent. in Louisville,
Ky., to 53.3 per cent. in San Antonio, Texas, the aggregate for the
whole group being about 28 per cent. He remarks that this agrees
with scattered observations in the first phase of the 1889–1890 epidemic,
when the attack rate seems to have varied within these limits.
In five of the localities studied, geographically widely separated, the
incidence rate varied only within a narrow limit, from 200 to 250 per
thousand. Variations in attack rate showed no apparent consistent
relation to geographic location or size of community, or to the rapidity
of development of the epidemic.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a house-to-house survey of 10,000 individuals in Boston the
author found that in the winter of 1918–19, 19.71 per cent., or one-fifth
of the entire population had developed the disease. It should be
pointed out that while the standards used in this survey are entirely
comparable to those used by Frost, the author has, contrary to Frost’s
method, not included in his group of positive cases those classified
as “doubtful.” This would raise the total incidence to a certain
extent, but we feel convinced that by omitting the doubtful cases we
have approached nearer to a correct picture of the epidemic as it
actually occurred. As will be seen from Chart XVI there was no great
variation in the different districts studied, with the exception of Districts
IV and V. Districts I, II and III were in the tenement section
of the city, while District VI was in one of the finest residential parts
of Brookline. Districts IV and V were midway between these two extremes
as regards economic and sanitary status, as well as extent of
crowding. The lowest incidence was in the Irish tenement district.
The highest in a middle class Jewish population.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>In the 1920 recurrence we found that 9.55 per cent., or one-tenth of
the entire population, suffered from the disease, and the arrangement
of districts in order of incidence was very little changed. The Irish
community suffered least; the two middle class communities most.
The well-to-do district in Brookline had the next lowest incidence in
1920. That the high recorded incidence in middle class districts was
not due to more accurate or more thorough work on the part of the
inspectors is indicated by the fact that a great part of the work on
Districts IV and V was done by the same individuals who inspected
Districts II and III.</p>

<p class='c007'>One-fifth of the population studied developed the influenza in
1918–19, and one-tenth of the same population suffered in 1920.</p>

<p class='c007'>We may agree with Winslow and Rogers, who conclude that the
proportion of the population actually affected by the influenza epidemic
in 1918 varied between 200 and 400 per thousand.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Relation of sex to morbidity.</i>—Abbott concluded from his studies in
1890, that the weight of testimony appears to favor the statement that
persons of the male sex were attacked in greater number and with
greater severity than females. Leichtenstern reached similar conclusions.
In the epidemic of 1889, the males were attacked more
frequently than the females. He attributes this to two causes: first,
the greater exposure to infection, and; second, the fact that strong,
robust individuals are more frequently attacked.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is amusing to compare this explanation with another found in the
Medical Supplement to the Review of the Foreign Press for March,
1919. “A Spanish mission composed of Maranon, Pittaluga and
Falco visited Paris last October to collect information as to the identity
of the Spanish epidemic with the world pandemic of influenza. They
found that the epidemics in France and Spain were absolutely identical
from the epidemiologic, bacteriologic and clinical standpoint. The
great majority of the severe cases in both countries occurred between
the ages of 16 and 40. Both in France and Spain more females than
males were attacked, which was possibly explained by the greater
tendency of the former to lead an indoor existence.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Jordan, Reed and Fink, working in Chicago, found very different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>results. They could discover no noteworthy difference among the
pupils in high school and elementary school. The attack rate was
230 for the boys and 231 for girls. One sex was presumably as much
exposed as the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the employees of the Chicago Telephone Company, on the
other hand, the men were affected in considerably lighter proportion
than the women (151 per 1,000 as compared with 233 per 1,000 for
women). Jordan believes that the age factor was largely responsible
for the difference as the women employees are as a rule of much lower
average age than the men.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frost found that with few exceptions the attack rate at all ages
was somewhat higher in females than in males. The total excess of
incidence in females was six per cent., which ranged from an excess
of nineteen per cent. in the highest locality to a deficiency of two per
cent. in the lowest. Only two of the eleven localities surveyed showed
a lower incidence among females than among males.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the sexes were compared in different age groups, the female
was found to be higher than the male in each age period except under
5, 10 to 14, 40 to 44, and 70 to 74. The excess of incidence in males in
these groups is relatively small, and is hardly significant in the highest
age groups, where the rates are computed from small figures. Frost
found the most striking excess of incidence in females occurring
between the ages of fifteen and forty, the difference between the sexes
being relatively slight in age periods above and below these limits.
Females over the age of fifteen and especially between the ages of 15
and 45 were either more susceptible to infection, or more generally
and more intimately exposed than males of corresponding age.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our own records by the different age groups were remarkably
similar. We have found an excess among the females in every age
except under five years, 10 to 14, 50 to 54, and 60 to 64. In 1920 we
found a slight excess among the males up to the age of 15, and again
at the ages 55 to 65. Females predominated in all other ages (Chart
XVII). Among those individuals who had attacks of influenza
during both epidemics females again predominated except in the ages
under 5 years, 10 to 14 and 55 to 59. In our own results we find that
ages above 65 show a predominance of females.</p>

<p class='c007'>After considering both series of results it is safe to generalize
in saying that above the age of 15 the female sex tends to acquire the
disease in slightly greater proportion than the male sex.</p>

<p class='c007'>Chart XV shows the predominance of the female incidence in both
epidemics.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span><i>Relationship of sex to severity.</i>—In classifying cases as to severity,
we have followed the standard previously described. Our results
have shown that the 1920 recurrence in our group of individuals has
been decidedly milder than the earlier 1918 spread. The proportion
of mild cases in 1920 is nearly twice that of mild attacks in 1918–19.
The proportion of severe cases was twice as great in 1918 as in 1920.
The actual severity in 1918 was even greater than would be indicated
by these figures. The last column in Chart XVIII is a combination
of the two preceding, and while the 1920 column includes all classed
as severe, pneumonia, and fatal, that for 1918 only includes the severe
and pneumonia cases, but does not include the fatal cases for that
year, because those who died during the 1918–19 epidemics are not
counted in our 10,000 individuals surveyed. If these were included
the percentage of total severe, or average severity would be greater
than 42.70.</p>

<p class='c007'>We find that in 1918 the female sex had a higher proportion of
severe cases according to our standard than did the male. This was
equally true in 1920. We should emphasize here that we are not comparing
only the fatal cases in the two sexes, but all classified as severe,
and including fatal in 1920.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not only was the female sex attacked in slightly greater proportion,
but also the individual cases appear to have been on the aggregate
somewhat more severe in that sex.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Morbidity by age.</i>—Before discussing the incidence of influenza in
the various age periods we should explain that the charts for 1920 are
based on the ages given by the individuals, and those for 1918 upon
these ages, corrected by the subtraction of 15 months from the age as
given. In our study of cases recurring during both epidemics the age
used in the calculations is that of 1920. It is for this reason that in
all of our age charts we have a first age period from zero to 15 months.
Infants of less than 15 months at the time of our survey were born
subsequent to the peak of the 1918–19 epidemic, and are not included
in computations for that time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The general similarity of the age incidence in the six districts
studied (Charts XIX and XX) is evident. As a rule two peaks can
be discerned, one falling somewhere between 15 months and 9 years,
and the other between 20 and 39 years. There are individual variations
in the different districts, and in Districts IV, V and VI there is a
tendency toward a peak in the period 55 to 64. This, however, disappears
when the total 10,000 is tabulated, when the two peaks, 15
months to 9 years, and 20 to 39, show out clearly for the year 1918
(Chart XVII).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Frost found for the same epidemic that the attack rate was highest
in the age group 5 to 9, declining with almost unbroken regularity in
each successive higher age group, with the exception of the groups 25
to 34, in which the attack rates were higher than in the age groups 15
to 24, but not as high as that of 5 to 9.</p>

<p class='c007'>Both series of observations agree in finding relatively high incidence
in early childhood and in early adult life.</p>

<p class='c007'>For 1920 (Chart XVII) we find that these peaks, although present,
have become decidedly less prominent, and that there is a relatively
higher incidence in individuals past the age of 40 (Charts XXI and
XXII). There is some tendency toward straightening out of the
curve; age appears to have played a less important part, and those
higher ages which were relatively insusceptible in 1918 have become
more susceptible in 1920. We cannot generalize in the statement that
all ages which were lightly attacked in the first epidemic were more
severely attacked in the 1920 spread, because the ages from 10 to 19
are found to be relatively lower during both epidemics.</p>

<p class='c007'>Other observations have been made regarding the age incidence
particularly during the 1918 pandemic. Jordan’s figures for the
October epidemic show a higher incidence among school children of
ages 4–13 than among those of higher school age, 14–18. The teachers
in these schools had a lower attack rate than the pupils. The pupils
in both school groups were from the same section of the city and to a
large extent from the same families and were presumably exposed in
similar degree.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lynch and Cumming found that of 49,140 children in public institutions
the influenza rate was 412 per 1,000, while among 703,006 adults
in similar institutions the rate was 263 per 1,000. These figures
include children in a large number of institutions scattered throughout
the United States, and would indicate that in childhood the susceptibility
is much greater than in adults.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many writers agree that nursing infants show a relative insusceptibility.
However Abt records a case of an expectant mother who, within
two weeks of term, developed influenza, and during the course of
her illness gave birth to a baby boy, who at birth was found to be
suffering from bronchitis and bronchopneumonia, but who lived for
three days, finally dying of bronchopneumonia. Abt concludes from
a review of all of the facts that the newly born infant had influenza
and that the baby had become infected before birth.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>According to Carnwath, the age incidence showed curious changes.
During the 1918 summer wave the ages most affected were 15 to 45.
In the winter of 1918–19 there was a considerable shifting toward the
extremes of life and particularly toward the younger years. The
susceptibility of young children was the subject of a special inquiry in
London. Though the attack rate was below the average, the chances of
recovery were less than in other age groups. Of breast-fed infants,
30 per cent. contracted the disease; of artificially-fed 54 per cent. The
opposite, however, occurred in lying-in homes. An inquiry in Cheshire
revealed that 25.4 per cent. of expectant mothers affected died.</p>

<p class='c007'>Renon and Mignot have made a report on the 1920 recurrence.
According to them the grip of 1920 attacked all ages, in contradistinction
to the 1918 epidemic, which attacked especially the young
and vigorous. One-third of their group were over 40 years of age,
while some were 70 and 80 years old. In spite of this the disease
remained relatively mild.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Age morbidity in previous epidemics.</i>—Previous to the epidemic of
1889–93, the various recorded observations regarding morbidity, and
particularly regarding age morbidity, have consisted often of records
made by practising physicians, and are merely estimates based upon
their clinical experience and varying with the type of individual
treated by them. Or else they have been records made by non-medical
historians. During the 19th century, the tendency toward statistical
enumeration becomes more and more prominent, but the first statistical
studies of real value to the epidemiologist were made in the epidemic
of thirty years ago. Statistical study must begin with this last
epidemic. Observations of the earlier epidemics, while very interesting
for reference and comparison, are no longer acceptable as
unquestioned statements of fact. Even at the present time and with all
of the emphasis that is now being laid upon statistical procedure the
records are far from perfect, and it is to be hoped that in years to come
the improvement will be so decided that the records even of the 1918–20
epidemics will appear crude.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buoninsegni remarks of the 1387 epidemic that many individuals of
all ages died, but the deaths were particularly prevalent among the
aged.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jacob, of Königshofen, writes that “there came a general pestilence
in the whole country, with cough and influenza, so that hardly one
among ten remained healthy,” and that old and debilitated persons
were frequently the victims.</p>

<p class='c007'>Balioanus tells us that the epidemic of 1404 let not rank, age nor
sex escape its effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1557, according to Valleriola, the disease appeared with pestilential
rapidity, and spared neither sex, nor any age, nor rank, neither
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>children nor old persons, rich nor poor, but that it was not as a general
rule dangerous; children only, who could not freely cough out the
phlegm, dying.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same story is told by Molineux, for 1693, “All conditions of
persons were attacked, those residing in the country as well as those in
the city; those who lived in the fresh air and those who kept to their
rooms; those who were very strong and hardy were taken in the same
manner as the weak and spoiled; men, women and children, persons of
all ranks and stations in life, the youngest as well as the oldest.”
Molineux, however, added that, “it rather favored the very old who
seldom were attacked with it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>These observations are but broad generalizations; if we pause to
study the psychology of the historian we are tempted to conclude that
his primary object was to impress his readers with an idea of the enormousness
of the dissemination of the disease during his period. That
being the main endeavor, a tendency to exaggerate for the sake of
rhetoric and yet remain within the limits of truth may be considered
excusable. But during the 1889–93 epidemic there was ample opportunity
to compare the estimates made by the practising physicians
with the later statistical tabulations. As a rule the former were
higher both as regards morbidity and mortality.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the 1830–32 epidemic an interesting observation has been made.
While Kahlert says that no distinction between age, sex nor rank
occurred, Leberscht stated that persons of middle age, especially women
in the climacteric period, were attacked with special frequency. This
is of interest in view of the findings in the 1918 epidemic. Krimer
states for the same epidemic that children under 14 years of age and
adults over 45 years were spared by the epidemic.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the 1836–37 epidemic Finkler records the following: “Most of
the patients were adults from 20 to 40 years of age, and of these more
women than men were attacked. Curiously, however, the physicians
of Würtenberg speak of the great dissemination of the disease among
children.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1847–48, among the adult influenza patients, there are said to
have been more women than men. According to Canstatt, there were
proportionately more children than adults attacked.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1889–90, according to Finkler, no age was spared, but persons
between 20 and 50 years of age were attacked by preference. No
trade was a sure protection. The course of the disease in general was
favorable and also quite rapid, unfavorable only in many children
during the first few years of life, in many old people, in many debilitated
persons, and especially in those suffering from chest affections.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>An interesting table of this kind is given us by Leichtenstern.
His hospital material included 439 influenza patients, and these he
carefully grouped according to age.</p>

<p class='c007'>Comby found that in Paris only the new-born were noticeably insusceptible
to influenza, that children up to 15 years were attacked in the
proportion of 40 per cent., and adults in the proportion of 60 per cent.
Danchez believed that in families in which all the adults became ill, the
little children usually escaped.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finkler states that in the schools at Bordeaux the older children
were first and most frequently attacked. Of the 248 male and female
teachers in 41 schools, 153 (61.7 per cent.) developed the disease.
Children up to five or six years of age at any rate seem to have been
very little affected, while older children were no less susceptible than
adults.</p>

<p class='c007'>The increase of disease incidence with age is apparent. Finkler’s
explanation for the higher incidence among the children of the suburbs,
“that the children in the country had usually to walk a greater
distance to school” does not appear to be complete.</p>

<p class='c007'>Comby found that out of 3,411 school children in Lausanne 1,840
contracted influenza. This shows a relatively high incidence in
children of school age in that city.</p>

<p class='c007'>Concerning age distribution in 1889–90 Leichtenstern remarks that
the greatest morbidity incidence was in school children, adolescents
and young adults, especially the last. Nursing infants were attacked
in considerably less degree than any of these other ages. Also in the
higher ages those above sixty were attacked in lesser degree. The
greatest morbidity frequently was between the ages of twenty and
forty. Abbott concluded on the basis of estimates furnished him
from various institutions and individuals in the State that people of
all ages were attacked but the ratio of adults was greatest, of old
people next, and of children and infants least.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Relationship of occupation to morbidity incidence.</i>—Leichtenstern
found that the only apparent influence of occupation on the incidence
of influenza depended upon the liability to exposure in the various
occupations. He remarks particularly on the large incidence of
influenza among physicians. In contrast was the low incidence in
lighthouse keepers. In 1889–90 among 415 dwellers on 51 lightships
and 20 isolated lighthouses on the English coast only 8 persons developed
influenza and these in four localities, and in every instance
there was traceable direct communication from some other source.
There is contradictory evidence as to whether individuals working out
of doors are more apt to develop influenza. Certain statistics show
that postmen and individuals working on railroads were attacked more
frequently and earlier than others, while other statistics show that
in railroads the office personnel was attacked earlier than individuals
on the trains and those working on the tracks.</p>

<p class='c007'>Abbott concluded that special occupations did not appear to have
had a marked effect in modifying the severity of the epidemic. At
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>the Boston Post Office in 1889–90, of the indoor employees, 475 in
number, 25 per cent. were attacked. Of the carriers, 450 in number,
11 per cent. were affected with the disease. But there were other
reports of the same period which stated that the ratio of the persons
employed at outdoor occupations who were attacked was greater than
that of indoor occupation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finkler has discussed the influence of occupation at some length:</p>

<p class='c007'>“When we compare the statistics of the last pandemic concerning
the influence of vocation, we see in the first place that those first and
chiefly were attacked whose occupation compelled them to remain in
the open air. This was shown especially by Neidhardt, who studied
the influenza epidemic in the Grand Duchy of Hesse. His conclusions,
however, were disputed by others. Thus, the prejudicial influence
of exposure to the open air was not supported by the statistics of railroad
employees in Saxony. Of those who were employed in the outdoor
service, 32 per cent. became ill; of those employed in office work,
on the other hand, 40 per cent. The statistics of the local benefit
societies in Plauen show that the percentage of the sick among farm
hands and builders was not greater than that among the members
of other benefit societies who worked indoors. In Schwarzenberg
the laborers in the forest who were working in the open air all day were
affected less than others, and there was no sickness whatever in some
forest districts. Lancereaux, of Paris, states that most of the railroad
employees who suffered from influenza were those engaged in office
work and not those who worked in the open air. The preponderance
of influenza patients among the factory hands may be seen from a table
prepared by Ripperger:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>“Many peculiar records of how individual classes of occupation
have fared are obviously to be explained by the fact that the infection
manifested its action in very different degrees. Thus, among the
workmen on the Baltic ship-canal only those became ill who lived in
the town of Rendsburg; those who had been housed in barracks outside
of the city were not affected. Of the 438 lead workers of Rockhope,
which is situated in a lonely valley in Durham, all remained perfectly
free from the disease during the three epidemics of 1889–92.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Some occupations are said to afford protection against influenza.
Thus workmen in tanneries, chloride of lime, tar, cement, sulphuric
acid, glass, and coke works, are said to have escaped the disease with
extraordinary frequency.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We shall be compelled perhaps to agree with Leichtenstern in his
conclusion that occupation and social position only in so far exert an
influence on the frequency of the disease as certain occupations in life
lead to more or less contact with travellers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very remarkable is the proportionately small number of soldiers
affected, at least in the Prussian army, where, according to the official
record, the epidemic from its beginning to its end attacked only 101.5
per thousand of the entire forces.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Comparison of morbidity by occupation necessarily includes so
many variables and so many factors other than occupation that the
results are decidedly unsatisfactory. An example is found in Jordan,
Reed and Fink’s report of the incidence among troops in the Student
Army Training Camps in Chicago. They found a strikingly different
attack rate in the various groups studied. In the Chicago Telephone
Exchange they ranged from 30 to 270 per 1,000, although the working
conditions in the various exchanges were not materially different.
In the Student Army Training Corps at the University of Chicago
the lowest was 39 and the highest 398 per 1,000. The higher rate
group was particularly exposed to infection while the lower, although
composed of men of similar ages, living under similar conditions, were
guarded to a considerable extent against contact with beginning
cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>Woolley has made an interesting observation on the effect of
occupation: “The disease was no respecter of persons except that it
was more severe in those who were hard workers. Those who tried to
‘buck the game’ and ‘stay with it’ showed the highest mortality
rates. So, the non-commissioned officers and the nurses suffered
more severely than the commissioned officers and privates.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The above figures are for the period of five weeks from August
28th to October 1st, 1918, and cover the most active portion of the
epidemic, but are obviously incomplete. They are given for purposes
of comparison.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Woolley makes the observation that the organizations which spent
most of the time in the open and which were therefore most exposed
to the weather suffered least during the epidemic. This was particularly
true in the Remount Depot.</p>

<p class='c007'>In our work we have attempted to classify our population according
to occupation along very broad lines.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>Infant</i>” includes all individuals up to the age of two years. In
these the exposure is limited by the fact that they are either relatively
isolated at home, or when abroad, are still under relative isolation in a
perambulator or under the eye of a nurse. There is relatively little
commingling with the older age groups.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>Child</i>,” refers to all children up to the age of school years. There
is relatively much greater commingling, particularly with other individuals
of the same age.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>School</i>” refers to all children and adolescents who were reported
as attending school.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>Home</i>” includes not only the housewife, the housekeeper, but also
servants and invalids; all who in their daily routine spend the greater
part of the time in the home.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>“<i>Manual Indoors</i>” refers chiefly to laborers in factories and
includes all manufacturing occupations in which the work is of a
manual character no matter what the particular branch.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>Manual Outdoors</i>” refers to such occupations as ditch diggers,
street cleaners, conductors and motormen, longshoremen, trucksters
and teamsters, telephone and telegraph linemen, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>Retail Sales Indoors</i>” refers to clerks in stores and all other
individuals who, working indoors, come into about the same degree of
contact with the public-at-large.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>Retail Sales Outdoors</i>” includes sales agents, life insurance agents,
traveling salesman, pedlers, newsboys, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<i>Office</i>,” officials, secretaries, stenographers, telephone operators,
telegraph operators, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have observed that in 1918 infants presented the lowest incidence
and school children the highest. Occupations designated Home
and Office were surprisingly high. Children also showed a high incidence,
one out of every five developing the disease. The records show
that manual labor, both indoors and outdoors, was associated with a
higher incidence than less strenuous work, as retail sales, indoors and
outdoors (Chart XXIII).</p>

<p class='c007'>The attack rates in most of the occupations are so nearly the same
as to lead to no certain conclusions. It would appear from our records
that individuals working out of doors were less frequently attacked
than those whose occupation kept them in doors. The groups at the
two extremes of incidence correspond to what we should expect when
considering opportunities for contract. The infant has least direct
contact. His contact is only with one or a few individuals, the mother
or the nurse. This group developed the disease in 5.8 per cent. The
school child not only has the same degree of contact as do adults, but
also in the tussle and scramble of play the contact becomes much
closer. The factor of age plays a large part in the occupational distribution
and the apparent occupational susceptibility is influenced
by the age susceptibility.</p>

<p class='c007'>When we consider the occupational incidence in the various districts
we find that the only constant feature in the relatively small
groups is the low incidence among infants (Chart XXIV).</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>The first fact gained from a study of the 1920 occupational case
rate is that just as was the case in age incidence there is less variation
between the highest and the lowest than in 1918–19. While in the first
epidemic the highest occupational rate was five times the lowest, in
the second it was only twice the lowest (Chart XXV). But at the
extremes of the two charts we see some tendency to an inversion of the
order. In 1918–19 those occupied in “retail sales” outdoors showed
a low incidence, while in 1920 they were the highest. So also, the
incidence in the school group changed from highest in 1918 to lowest
in 1920. The incidence in infants increased; that in the office workers
decreased. No general conclusions are warranted from these results.</p>

<p class='c007'>In comparing the sex incidence by age groups we have found that
females as a rule showed a slightly greater incidence than males.
That this is not due fundamentally to occupational differences is
suggested by a comparison of the sex incidence in the two epidemics
studied. In 1918 the distribution is practically the same in the two
sexes in all occupations except “Home,” “Manual Outdoors,”
“Retail Sales Indoors,” “Retail Sales Outdoors” (Chart XXVI). In
the first the number of males is so small and in the second and fourth the
number of females is so small that these cannot justly be compared.
The group, “Retail Sales,” consists in 1918–19 of 69 males and 27
females, out of a total distribution in the population of 426 males and
107 females. This is the only occupation that showed a definite
higher incidence among the females, and even here the number is too
small for accuracy. In 1920 this difference has practically disappeared.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Effect of race stock.</i>—Leichtenstern remarks in his monograph that
the reported differences in influenza morbidity among different races,
such for instance as European and other nationalities, doubtless are
due to factors other than genetic racial differences, such as different
modes of living, commerce, etc. The work of the last two years calls
for a reconsideration of this idea.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frost in his valuable work found that “in the seven localities with
considerable colored population the incidence rates among the colored
were uniformly lower than among the whites, the difference persisting
after adjustment of the rate to a uniform basis of sex and age distribution.
The extent of the difference varied, being relatively great in
Baltimore, Augusta and Louisville, and very small in Little Rock.
This relatively low incidence in the colored race is quite contrary to
what would have been expected a priori, in view of the fact that the
death rate from pneumonia and influenza is normally higher in the
colored than in the white, and that the colored population lived generally
under conditions presumably more favorable to the spread of
contact infection.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Brewer, in his study of influenza in September, 1918, at Camp
Humphreys, finds that the colored troops showed a decidedly lower
rate than the white troops throughout the epidemic. He finds that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>the incidence among colored troops was only 43 per cent. of that
among whites. The difference between colored and white organizations
was probably not due to difference in housing. Most of the
colored troops were in tents and the white troops were all in barracks.
But the 42d Company composed of negroes was housed in barracks
under the same conditions as the white troops of other organizations
and they had next to the lowest incidence of all organizations. Brewer
concludes that the colored race when living under good hygienic
conditions is not as susceptible to influenza as the white race under the
same conditions. The age distribution was the same in both groups.</p>

<p class='c007'>Armstrong concluded from figures based on reported cases of
influenza that in the autumn of 1918 proportionately four times as
much influenza and pneumonia was reported among the Italians as was
reported for the rest of the Framingham community, made up largely
of Irish or Irish-American stock. On the contrary, an examination of a
large proportion of the population of that town showed a tuberculosis
incidence among the Italian race stock of .48, in contrast to an incidence
among the Irish of 4.85 per cent. and of 2.16 per cent. in the
entire population. Armstrong contrasts the relative insusceptibility
of Italian stock to tuberculosis, with the apparent marked susceptibility
to acute disease of the respiratory tract, such as influenza
and pneumonia; and the high susceptibility of the Irish to tuberculosis,
with their low susceptibility to acute respiratory infection.</p>

<p class='c007'>With regard to our work it is sufficient to state that the lowest
incidence in both epidemics, as well as in recurrent cases, was in the
Irish tenement districts. Both the Jewish and the Italian tenement
districts were slightly higher in both epidemics (Charts XIX and XXI).
The age distribution of the entire population of each of these three
districts was about the same, so it does not appear that the slightly
lower incidence among the Irish is due to a variation in the age distribution
of the population.</p>

<p class='c007'>The subject of race in relation to influenza will be discussed further
under mortality.</p>

<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Mortality.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>According to Marchese, in 1387 at Forli in Italy, not a person
escaped the disease, but only a few died. Gassar says that during the
same epidemic in Germany the patients suffered four, or at most five,
days with the most disagreeable catarrhal symptoms and delirium, but
recovered, and only very few were removed by death.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pasquier remarks concerning an epidemic in 1411 that an infinitude
of individuals were attacked but that none died.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Concerning the epidemic of 1414 in France, Lobineau relates that
the disease was fatal only for the aged. Mezeray also speaks of the
high mortality of the old in this epidemic.</p>

<p class='c007'>Regarding the pandemic of 1510, Thomas Short remarks that none
died except some children. Mezeray, on the other hand, says that the
disease had claimed many victims.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pasquier and Valleriola both write of the epidemic of 1557, in
France, as being distinctly mild in character. Children only who
could not freely cough out the phlegm died. Coyttar speaks of the
absence of death except in tuberculous patients.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the pandemic of 1580 individual observers report enormous
death rates. Thus, according to Schenkius, the disease killed 9,000
persons in Rome, while Madrid, Barcelona and other Spanish cities
were said to have been nearly depopulated by the disease. This high
mortality was, however, even at that time attributed by some physicians
to the injudicious employment of venesection. Throughout
the more recent history of pandemic influenza opinion seems to have
been nearly unanimous that blood letting has had very bad results in
the outcome of influenza cases. Remarks to this effect have been made
by the contemporaries of nearly every epidemic since 1580.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Rayger and others during the epidemic of 1675,
nobody died of the disease itself with the exception of debilitated
persons, although it spared neither the weak nor the strong.</p>

<p class='c007'>Concerning the epidemic of 1688, Thomas Short writes for England
that though not one of fifteen escaped it, yet not one of a thousand
that had it died.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1712, Slevogt writes that in Germany “Fear soon vanished when
it was seen that although it had spread all over the city, it left the
sick with equal rapidity.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Finkler remarks, concerning 1729–30, that, “The great mortality
which attended the epidemic in England and Italy seems somewhat
remarkable. Thus Hahn states that in London in the month of September
one thousand persons died each week, and in Mayence forty persons
daily. Most likely, however, other diseases which were present at the
same time added their quota to the mortality, especially as the disease
in other places, for example in Germany, ran a benign course.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Perkins, Huxham, Pelargus, Carl and others, concerning the
epidemic of 1732–33, all testify that the disease was of very low fatality.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1742 the epidemic was evidenced by an enormous morbidity but
the disease was not dangerous as a general rule although Huxham
occasionally speaks of the virulent character of the disease in England,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>and Cohansen says that in January, 1743, over 8,000 persons died
from influenza in Rome and 5,000 in Mayence.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have the testimony of Robert Whytt, for 1758, and that of
Razoux and Saillant and Ehrman for 1762, as to the low mortality of
the epidemic for those years.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Heberden the same was true for 1775, while Webster
tells us for 1780 that the disease was not dangerous but its effects were
seen the following year in the increased number of cases of phthisis.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finkler remarks concerning the epidemic of 1802, “The mortality in
this epidemic was small, only the abuse of venesection brought many to
the grave. Thus, so many farmers are said to have died in Russia
from it that venesection was forbidden by an imperial ukase. Jonas
says that many patients were bled either on the advice of a simple
village barber or by their own wish, and most of them died. In
Prussia also bleeding was declared detrimental by the Government.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He continues regarding 1836–37, that, “In London there died,
during the week ending January 24, 1837, a total of 871 persons, and
among these deaths there were 295 from disease of the respiratory
organs; during the week ending January 31st, out of a total of 860
deaths there were 309 from diseases of the respiratory organs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Watson, in describing the epidemic of 1847, discusses the mortality:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The absolute mortality has been enormous; yet the relative mortality
has been small. You will hear people comparing the ravages of
the influenza with those of the cholera, and inferring that the latter is
the less dangerous complaint of the two; but this is plainly a great
misapprehension. Less dangerous to the community at large (in this
country at least) it certainly has been; but infinitely more dangerous to
the individuals attacked by it. More persons have died of the influenza
in the present year than died of the cholera when it raged in 1832;
but then a vastly greater number have been affected with the one
disease than with the other. I suppose that nearly one-half of those
who were seized with the cholera perished; while but a very small
fraction, indeed, not more probably than two per cent. of those who
suffered influenza have sunk under it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Leichtenstern remarks on the very low mortality of 1889–90. In
Munich 0.6 per cent. died; in Rostock 0.8 per cent.; in Leipzig 0.5 per
cent.; in fifteen Swiss cities 0.1 per cent.; in Karlsruhe 0.075 per cent.;
in Mecklenburg-Schwerin 1.2 per cent. This does not, however,
include the numerous deaths from complications, as from pneumonia,
and does not express the true mortality.</p>

<p class='c007'>Newsholme gives the following table for mortality from influenza,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>bronchitis and pneumonia, in England and Wales during the epidemic
years and the years immediately preceding them. The figures express
annual death rate per million of population. The highest rate was
reached in 1891. The table does not include deaths registered as from
other diseases, but due directly or indirectly to influenza. Respiratory
diseases in general show a greatly increased death rate in years in
which influenza is epidemic. Such is also true to some extent with
diseases of the nervous and the circulatory systems.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a report by the United States Public Health Service early in
1919 the death rates from all causes in twelve large cities of this country
were compared for 1889–90 and for 1918–19. It was found that while
considerable irregularity in the curves was evident, the curves of the
two epidemics manifested on the whole quite a striking similarity for
the same cities considered individually and for the group as a whole.
The death rate rose to a much higher point during the autumn wave
of the 1918 epidemic than in the epidemic of 1889–90 in nine out of the
twelve cities. During both epidemics the rate was relatively low in
St. Louis, Milwaukee and Minneapolis. The mortality in all of these
cities was 26.7 in 1889, as against 35.2 for 1918. In the peak week the
rate rose to 55.6 in 1918 as against 35.4 in 1889.</p>

<p class='c007'>The influenza deaths in Massachusetts in the year 1890 during a
period of fifty days were estimated by Abbott to have been 2,500. In
1918 Jordan estimates the mortality for the same state to have been
six times as great. The population of the state had not doubled in
the interval. The highest mortality from influenza in Massachusetts
during the 1889–93 epidemic occurred in January, 1892, during which
month the total deaths amounted to 6,309 which was greater by 2,246
than the mean monthly mortality of the year, and greater by more
than 1,000 than the mortality of any month in the ten year period
1883–92.</p>

<p class='c007'>A comprehensive comparison of the damage done by influenza in
1918 with the deaths from other plagues has been made by Vaughan
and Palmer.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>“The pandemic of 1918, when compared with that of 1889–90 is
estimated to have caused <i>six times as many deaths</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>“During the four autumn months of 1918, 338,343 cases of influenza
were reported to the Surgeon General. This means that in the
camps of this country <i>one out of every four men had influenza</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The combination between influenza and pneumonia during the
fall of 1918 seems to have been closer and more destructive than in any
previous pandemic. During the autumn season there were reported
to the Surgeon General 61,691 cases of pneumonia. This means that
<i>one out of every twenty-four men encamped in this country had pneumonia</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>“During the same period 22,186 men were reported to have died
from the combined effects of influenza and pneumonia. This means
that among the troops in this country <i>one out of every sixty-seven died</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This fatality has been unparallelled in recent times. The influenza
epidemic of 1918 ranks well up with the epidemics famous in
history. Epidemiologists have regarded the dissemination of cholera
from the Broad Street Well in London as a catastrophe. The typhoid
epidemic of Plymouth, Pa., of 1885, is another illustration of the damage
that can be done by epidemic disease once let loose. Yet the
accompanying table shows that the fatality from influenza and pneumonia
at Camp Sherman was greater than either of these. Compared
with epidemics for which we have fairly accurate statistics the death
rate at Camp Sherman in the fall of 1918 is surpassed only by that of
plague in London in 1665 and that of yellow fever in Philadelphia in
1793.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The plague killed 14 per cent. of London’s population in seven
months’ time. Yellow fever destroyed 10 per cent. of the population
of Philadelphia in four months. In seven weeks influenza and pneumonia
killed 3.1 per cent. of the strength at Camp Sherman. If we
consider the time factor, these three instances are not unlike in their
lethality. The plague killed 2 per cent. of the population in a month,
yellow fever 2.5 per cent. and influenza and pneumonia 1.9 per cent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In four months typhoid fever killed 1.5 per cent. of the soldiers
encamped in this country during the war with Spain. Influenza and
pneumonia killed 1.4 per cent. of the soldiers in our camps in 1918 and
it also covered a period of four months.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Bureau of the Census has made the following report concerning
influenza deaths in the United States:</p>

<p class='c007'>“In forty-six American cities, having a combined population of
only a little more than one-fifth the total for the country, the mortality
resulting from the influenza epidemic during the nine weeks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>period ended November 9th was nearly double that in the A. E. F.
from the time the first contingent landed in France until the cessation
of hostilities.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The mortality, even as the morbidity, has varied in different
localities and at different periods. The low morbidity and mortality
in the spring of 1918 has been frequently mentioned. Among the
Esquimaux in Alaska the death toll was terrific. Whole villages of
Esquimaux lost their entire adult population. It has been estimated
that in British India the death roll totalled 5,000,000. “The central,
northern and western portions of India were the worst sufferers. The
hospitals in the Punjab were choked so that it was impossible to move
the dead quickly enough to make room for the dying. The streets
and lanes of the cities were littered with dead and dying people. The
postal and telegraph services were completely disorganized; the train
service continued, but at all principal stations dead and dying people
were being removed from the trains. The burning ghats and burial
grounds were literally swamped with corpses, while an even greater
number awaited removal. The depleted medical service, itself sorely
stricken by the epidemic, was incapable of dealing with more than a
minute fraction of the sickness requiring attention. Nearly every
household was lamenting death, and everywhere terror and confusion
reigned. No part of the Punjab escaped.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Bureau of the Census estimates that 445,000 deaths from the
epidemic of influenza occurred in the United States in the period between
September 1st and December 31st, 1918. There is no doubt but
that the total death toll for that epidemic exceeded 500,000 individuals.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Winslow and Rogers, the two highest annual death
rates on record in Connecticut are both rates of 19.4 per 1,000 and
these two rates are for the influenza epidemic years of 1892 and 1918.
In the earlier of these two the normal general death rate was several
points higher than it is today, so that the effect of the recent epidemic
was much more serious than was that of its predecessor. For a
single month the death toll of October, 1918, was absolutely unprecedented
in Connecticut. They estimate that the epidemic between
September, 1918, and January, 1919, cost the State 5.5 lives per 1,000
population, or, in all, 7,700 lives.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the United States Army there was a total of 688,869 admissions
for influenza. The total deaths ascribed to the disease are 39,731,
which gives a rate of 15.64 per 1,000 for the acute respiratory diseases
out of the total disease death rate of 18.81 for the year. In 1915 the
per cent. of deaths from this group of infections was under 18 per cent.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>of the total from all diseases. During the last four months of 1918,
11,670 deaths from influenza and pneumonia occurred in the American
Expeditionary Forces in France. There were approximately 1,600,000
officers and men in the United States and an equal number in France.</p>

<p class='c007'>Carnwath gives the following comparison of the number of deaths
in London and in certain American cities from influenza and all forms
of pneumonia during the eight weeks of the 1918–19 epidemic.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cause of death in the vast majority of cases is some form of
pneumonia. In fact it has been questioned whether influenza uncomplicated
can cause a fatal issue. Postinfluenzal meningitis has been
the cause of death in an appreciable number of cases. More remotely
the disease has caused many deaths by hastening the fatal outcome of
what were otherwise subacute or chronic conditions of the respiratory,
cardiovascular, or renal systems.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vaughan and Palmer record that, “The pandemic of influenza in
1918 seems to have been more closely associated with the pneumonias
than appears in any previous pandemic. From the reports as sent to
the Surgeon General’s Office, it appears that uncomplicated influenza
was not by any means a fatal disease and that the high death rate was
due to the pneumonias which followed. Pneumonia is a serious disease
at all times. Recent records for the United States Army show that the
case mortality rate for this disease has been as follows during the
different periods of the last two years:</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is not strange that once pneumonia has secured a foothold in
patients already weakened by influenza their chances of recovery were
lessened.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Woolley reports that for the troops stationed at Camp Devens, Mass.
there were no fatalities from uncomplicated influenza. In every fatal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>case but two a diagnosis of pneumonia was made, and in these two
cases pure cultures of pneumococcus were obtained from the blood
after death, so it appears that they were cases of pneumococcus
septicemia. Up to October 29, 1918, 19 per cent. of the total number
of influenza cases reported developed pneumonia and of these there
was a case mortality of 27.9 per cent. The mortality rate among the
influenza cases was 5.4 per cent.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Camp Humphreys, Virginia, 16 per cent. of the camp was
attacked by the disease; 28 per cent. of influenza cases had pneumonia;
10 per cent. of influenza cases died; and 35 per cent. of pneumonia
cases died. One and six tenths per cent. of the population of the
camp died from influenza. The camp had an average strength of
26,600 individuals. Fifty-two per cent. of the entire number of cases
occurred during the peak week which ended October 4th.</p>

<p class='c007'>Between September 21st and October 18th, 1918, 9,037 patients
were admitted to the Base Hospital at Camp Grant. This represented
about one-fourth of the strength of the camp. Of these 26 per cent.
developed pneumonia and 43 per cent. of the pneumonia cases died.
Death occurred to about 11 per cent. of the total admissions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The death rate at Camps Devens, Sherman and Grant were among
the highest of all of the camps in this country. The annual death
rate from all causes per 1,000 for the four last months of 1918 were 132
for Camp Cody, 123 for Syracuse, 116 for Camp Sherman, 102 for
Camp Beauregard, 97.3 for Camp Grant, 75.0 for Camp Dix, 67.0 for
Camp Devens. These seven camps stood out high above the majority.
By far the majority, 28 camps, had an annual rate between 61.9 and
25.5 per 1,000. Only four camps recorded lower rates than the latter
figure.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Municipal Statistics of Paris showed that during the first
half of October, 1918, the average weekly mortality was from two to
three times that of nonepidemic years. The returns for the Departments
of France also showed a mortality three times above the average
for previous years, though not uniformly so. In the Departments the
mortality from influenza did not exceed 10 per cent. and in many cases
it was below 5 per cent. On the other hand cases admitted to hospital,
which consisted of the worst forms of the disease, showed a mortality
varying between 12 and 30 per cent. Returns received from Italy
were similar. The disease in that country was especially severe in the
northern part and in the provinces bordering on Switzerland. Marcus,
of Stockholm, reported in September, 1918, that the epidemic in
Sweden was running a very severe course, more than 1,000 deaths
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>having occurred up to the time of his report. According to Weber,
2,770 deaths occurred in Berlin during October, 1918, from influenza
and pneumonia alone. In Vienna there died from influenza between
September 1st and October 19th, 1918, 3,125 persons. The deaths
in Vienna from influenza and pneumonia normally total 40 to 50 per
week. At the highest point of the epidemic this number had increased
to 1,468. Böhm estimates the total influenza incidence in Vienna as
180,000 cases, with a probable mortality around 1.7 per cent. Dunlop
estimates that the total number of influenza deaths in Scotland in
the winter of 1918–19 may be assessed at 20,000.</p>

<p class='c007'>A. Giltay has compared the epidemics of 1890 and 1900 with that of
1918 as regards mortality, in Amsterdam. He has studied figures for
seven consecutive weeks in each of the three periods under observation
and found that the maximum figures for mortality were 61.5 in 1890,
41.2 in 1900, and 52.7 in 1918, but if these figures are compared with
the average mortality for the year it is found that the increase of
mortality as the result of influenza alone is 39.3 for 1890, 24.5 for 1900,
and 40.3 for 1918. Thus the present epidemic is more severe than
that of 1890.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many reported mortality figures are without value because they are
either death rates in selected groups such as those in a hospital, or,
because the report does not state the status of the individual. Thus,
Hoppe-Seyler stated at a meeting of the Kiel Medical Society that of
577 cases treated in the Municipal Hospital, nearly all of which were
severe, 28.9 per cent. died. This was reduced to 18 per cent. after
deducting the cases admitted in a moribund condition. Again,
Rondopoulos reports that the October wave in Greece resulted in a
mortality of from 15 to 24 per cent, in different localities.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just as current vital statistics are of little value in determining
the morbidity rate, so also they cannot be relied upon in obtaining
fatality percentages. In organizations such as the Army, where all
cases are reported, we may get some idea of the fatality rate. The
deaths in the United States Army have already been discussed.
Marcus, of Stockholm, reports that the military records showed that
there had been 34,000 cases in the Swedish Army, with 444 deaths,
making a mortality of 1.3 per cent, in that Army.</p>

<p class='c007'>House surveys also give a fair idea of the mortality. Winslow and
Rogers conclude that the fatality rate was as a rule somewhere between
two and four deaths per 100 cases, the lower being more likely to be
correct. Reeks found in his house census that there had been 3.9
deaths per 100 cases in the autumn of 1918. Carnwath reports that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>Dr. Niven, in his census, discovered that out of 1,108 cases in the spring
and autumn of 1918 there were but 15 deaths, which would give a
fatality rate of 1.3 per 100 cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frost has found from his large survey that the ratio of deaths to
total cases of influenza varied in the localities surveyed from 3.1 per
cent. in New London as a high point to 2.8 per cent. in San Antonio,
Texas. There was some apparent relationship between fatality rate
and geographic distribution, the higher rates being in San Francisco on
the Pacific Coast, and in the localities studied on the north half of the
Atlantic Seaboard, and the lower rates being in the central and southern
states. The fatality rate on the Pacific Coast was 2.33, on the
Atlantic Seaboard 2.05, and in the last district 1.08 per cent.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our own figures correspond very closely with those of Frost.
Among the 10,000 living individuals surveyed in 1920 there were
1,970 cases of influenza in 1918. Add to this the 50 deaths for 1918,
which were not included in the 10,000 living individuals, which makes
a total incidence of 2,021. This case fatality rate of 2.47 per 100,
corresponds closely to Frost’s rate for the North Atlantic Seaboard.</p>

<p class='c007'>The relative mildness of the 1920 recurrence is indicated in the
lower case fatality rate. Fourteen out of 955 cases died, giving a rate
of 1.47 per 100 cases.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Mortality by sex.</i>—There is not a uniformity of opinion as to which
sex suffered the higher fatality rate during the 1918–19 spread.
Winslow and Rogers found for Connecticut a distinctly heavier mortality
among males for the last four months of 1918, 58 per cent. of the
influenza-pneumonia deaths being among this sex. They believe that
this is probably due to a greater exposure to the original infection.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fränkel and Dublin point out that in a study of 70,729 policy
holders of the Industrial Department of the Metropolitan Life Insurance
Company in the period from October 1, 1918, to June, 1919, the
death rates for males and females were practically the same for both
white and colored individuals.</p>

<p class='c007'>The excess of males over females among the whites is only three
per cent., and there was no excess among colored. In contrast, the
respiratory diseases, including influenza-pneumonia, under normal
conditions, show a higher mortality incidence among males than
among females. In the seven year period from 1911 to 1917 the mortality
rate showed an excess of 18 per cent. males over females, among
whites, and of 30 per cent. among colored. This would seem to indicate
that the effect of the epidemic was not much, if any, greater on
males than on females, and suggests that the excess mortality caused
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>by the epidemic did not operate on the sexes as the normal mortality
from influenza-pneumonia had in previous years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dunlop finds that in a study of 10,797 deaths registered in Scotland
up until the end of December, 1918, 52.44 per cent. were females and
47.56 were males. These were for deaths reported as due only to
influenza. Apert and Flipo found a decided predominance among the
female deaths in Paris. In both of these observations the absence
from the civilian population of male inhabitants of military age obscured
correct comparative statistics.</p>

<p class='c007'>Once again, Frost gives the most comprehensive discussion of the
subject. He found, as we have stated, that the influenza case incidence
in persons over fifteen years of age was higher in females than
in males, and that in persons under fifteen the relative incidence as
between males and females is variable, but with very slight excess in
males for the localities studied, combined. On the other hand, the
case fatality, the per cent. of influenza cases dying, under fifteen years
of age, was higher in females than in males. Over sixty years of age
it was considerably higher among the females, but between the ages
of fifteen and sixty the general tendency was to a much higher case
fatality among the males. The difference was greatest between the
ages of 20 and 40. The case fatality between the ages of 15 and 45
in the group of southern and central states was in decided contrast to
that in the Northern Atlantic and Pacific groups, the case fatality in
the former being remarkably low in both sections and slightly higher
in females than in males. He suggests that in the south and middle
west where the epidemic was generally milder in respect to mortality
than in the northeast and far west, the essential difference was not in
case incidence, but in case fatality, especially in persons from 15 to 45
years of age, and in the relatively low case fatality among young male
adults. Frost makes the important point that the relative mortality
is determined more accurately by case fatality than by case incidence,
and that without a full and exact knowledge of the variations in case
fatality, statistics of mortality are by no means translatable to terms of
relative morbidity. The fact that certain cities showed, as described
by Pearl, relatively high mortality rates, does not give conclusive evidence
that the morbidity was higher in these cities than elsewhere.
The lower influenza case fatality in females from 15 to 60 years of age
appears to be accounted for in part at least: first, by a decreased
incidence of pneumonia as compared with the males; and, second, by a
lower fatality in those cases which did develop pneumonia.</p>

<p class='c007'>The relatively small number of fatalities in our own records do not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>warrant a classification by age groups. We found that for all ages
in 1918 7.9 per cent. of females developed pneumonia as contrasted
with 6.8 per cent. males. This does not include those who died. In
1920, 1.87 per cent. of the male cases died, while only 0.37 per cent.
of the females died. Five and fifteen-hundredths per cent. of all male
cases developed pneumonia and recovered, and 3.56 of the females did
likewise. In 1920 a higher proportion of males than females developed
pneumonia, and likewise a higher proportion died.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Relationship of age.</i>—Leichtenstern has summarized the results for
the epidemic of thirty years ago, in saying that the death rate for
children under one year was little disturbed by the influenza epidemic;
that there was very little increase in mortality in the other ages of
childhood; that the higher age periods showed the greatest relative
mortality for the disease. On the contrary, the records for England
and for Switzerland showed during those periods a higher death rate
in children up to five years of age.</p>

<p class='c007'>Evans has studied the records for the city of Chicago in the epidemic
of the year 1890, and found that the number of deaths was
highest among persons from 20 to 40 years of age. The greater increase
above the expected was in deaths of persons over 60 years of
age. Children of school age seemed to enjoy some relative immunity,
as shown in the mortality reports.</p>

<p class='c007'>This latter age grouping for 30 years ago corresponds with those of
1918. Frost found that the death rate per 1,000 was notably high
in children under one year of age, in adults from 20 to 40, and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>persons over 60. The case fatality from pneumonia in his series
tended to be fairly constant, around 30 per cent., except in San Antonio,
Texas, where it was only 18.5 per cent. Case fatality was also
higher in the following age groups: Under one year, 20 to 40, and over
sixty.</p>

<p class='c007'>This age distribution was probably the same in all countries. Filtzos,
describing the epidemic in Greece, said that the ages that suffered
most and had the most fatal cases were between 20 and 45. In Spain
in May and June of 1918 the mortality was much lower among children
and the aged than it was among the adults, especially between 20 and
39 years of age. The disease appeared fatal almost exclusively in
these ages. In Vienna, 29.5 per cent. of all the fatal cases were
between the ages of 20 and 30. Hoppe-Seyler stated that the ages
of most of the cases were between 20 and 40 and the majority between
30 and 40, but that the mortality was highest among the older patients.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dunlop found that in Scotland the most frequent ages at death were
between 25 and 35, 25.28 per cent. of the total being between these
two ages. 53.85 per cent. of the total deaths were between 15 and
45 years. The highest age group death rates occurred in age groups
75 and over, and 25 to 35, the former being 7.87 per 1,000, and the
latter 7.12. High rates also occurred in age groups under one, and 65
to 75, the former being 6.49, and the latter 5.33. The lowest age
group death rates were found in the groups which included children
of school age, 5 to 15, being 2.20 per cent., and the age group 10 to 15,
being 1.80 per cent. Dunlop has apparently only included those
cases in which influenza was diagnosed as the cause of death, and has
omitted all in which the diagnosis was bronchitis or pneumonia.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Bureau of the Census has issued a report based on the mortality
in Indiana, Kansas and Philadelphia, for the period September 1st to
December 31st, 1918. It shows that the highest rate occurred in the
age period from 30 to 34 years, with the period from 25 to 29 second.
Of all the deaths tabulated more than half occurred between the period
of 20 to 40, although this age group represents only 33 per cent. of the
total population concerned.</p>

<p class='c007'>Age mortality has been studied thoroughly by Winslow and Rogers
in Connecticut:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The four last months of 1917 show a normal age distribution with
one quarter of all deaths occurring under five years of age, one quarter
between 5 and 40 years, and one-half over 40 years, the proportion of
the infant deaths decreasing and the proportion of deaths in old age
increasing as one passes from the season of intestinal disturbances to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>the season of respiratory diseases. In 1918 the distribution of deaths
from all causes is strikingly different. Instead of less than a quarter
of all deaths occurring between the ages of 5 and 40 years, this period
included 49 per cent. of all deaths in 1918; and the two decades between
20 and 40 included 40 per cent. of all deaths (as against only 14 per
cent. in 1917).</p>

<p class='c007'>“Considering influenza and pneumonia alone, these two decades
included 56 per cent. of the deaths, while only nine per cent. occurred
at ages over 49. The decade between 20 and 29 was most severely
affected, including 30 per cent. of all deaths, while the decade between
30 and 39 was a close second with 26 per cent. An even higher
incidence occurred at ages under five years, as has been brought out
in other investigations, since this age period contributed 16 per cent.
of all the influenza-pneumonia deaths. The proportion of deaths
from all causes in infancy did not rise even to normal, but with the
enormous rise in total deaths the maintenance of a nearly normal
ratio, of course, means a heavy influenza mortality.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Jordan observes in his analysis a low pneumonia incidence among
the pupils of elementary and high schools. There were no deaths in
188 cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wollstein and Goldbloom report that in a series of 36 children with
influenza and bronchopneumonia at the Babies Hospital in the City
of New York, 66.6 per cent. died. Achard and his co-workers review a
similar series of 32 infants in Paris with influenza. Eight of the 32
died. In both of these studies we are dealing with selected groups of
hospital cases and the mortality rates are of little value for this type
of study.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fränkel and Dublin in a study of 70,729 deaths from influenza-pneumonia
among the policyholders of the Industrial Department of
the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, find that during the normal
period between 1911 and 1917, influenza-pneumonia attacked primarily
the first age period of life, ages one to four years, and the period
of late middle life and old age. The rates are normally minimal between
5 and 30 years. In the last quarter of 1918, on the other hand,
the highest rate among the whites is in the period of early adult life,
between the ages of 25 and 34. There appear three modal points
instead of the two at the extremes. They find that the excess over
normal was most marked in infancy and early childhood, and particularly
in early adult life, culminating between the ages of 25 and 34.
The period of old age shows no significant <i>excess</i> during the period of
the epidemic.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>If the deaths among the white males of the age period of active
adult life had continued throughout the whole year as they did during
the last quarter of 1918, approximately four per cent. of the population
of that age would have died.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fränkel and Dublin are of the opinion that this change in the age
incidence of influenza mortality between epidemic and endemic periods
suggests strongly that the two diseases are different; that endemic
influenza is not the same disease as epidemic influenza. Or perhaps
they should say more correctly that the diseases occurring in interepidemic
times which are reported to them as deaths due to influenza-pneumonia
are not the same as the epidemic influenza. They draw
similar conclusions from the different manner in which the white and
black races are affected during the interepidemic and epidemic periods,
from so-called influenza-pneumonia. We have seen from Frost’s
results that it is hazardous to compare mortality rates of different
localities and different times with the idea of comparing the disease,
influenza, itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ages showing highest mortality in the autumn of 1918 appear
to have been essentially the same as those which predominated thirty
years ago. There appears to be nothing in the age distribution that
could be explained by an immunity persisting over from the epidemic
of 1889–93. The age group 30 to 40 has almost universally a higher
mortality than the groups below 20, which would by this theory be
non-immune and would be expected to have a higher rate. The drop
in rate is nearer the age group of 40 than 30. The presence of smaller
or larger influenza epidemics in the course of the thirty years would
further complicate such an hypothesis.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Relationship to occupation.</i>—Dublin found in a study of 4,700 miners
that the death rate was unusually high from influenza in these individuals
for the last quarter of 1918. In fact in the age period 45 to 65 the
rate among bituminous coal miners is close to four times as high as
among all occupied males. The annual death rate per thousand for
all ages among the former is 50.1; among all industrial white males,
22.3. The increase is apparent in all age groups from 15 to 65 inclusive.
These results are based on the records of the Metropolitan
Life Insurance Company.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Density of population.</i> <i>Rural and urban environment.</i>—There have
been few reports which have like the above described clearly variations
due apparently only to occupational differences. Some attention
has been paid to a comparison of the rural incidence with that in large
cities. Although other factors play a part here, we may consider
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>this under the general subject of occupation. Statistics for the fall
of 1918 from the Netherlands show that with the exception of men
over 80 years of age the mortality was remarkably increased for both
sexes in communities of less than 20,000 inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c007'>Winslow and Rogers have studied the variations in the urban and
rural incidence and find that in Connecticut with the single exception
of Tolland County, in which the small towns were severely hit, the
rates were in every case <i>higher</i> in the large communities. In New
Haven County, for instance, among nine towns which were purely
agricultural, the combined death rate from influenza and pneumonia
for the three months of September to November, inclusive, was 9.2
on an annual basis. For six towns in the same county in which there
were manufacturing plants the corresponding rate was 15.6. In
Litchfield County the twelve purely agricultural towns had a combined
rate of 6.5, whereas among eleven partly manufacturing towns the rate
was 18.3. This was true for other counties. The figures quoted
are for influenza-pneumonia rates only up to December 1st, but study
of the records during the early months of 1919 did not show any change
in the figures. The rates for the entire state for January, 1919, was
19.8, and that for the towns under 5,000, only 17.5.</p>

<p class='c007'>These observations differ somewhat from those reported by Pearl,
who studied 39 large cities of the United States in an attempt to find a
correlation between the explosiveness of the influenza outbreak and the
density of population. He concluded that there was no such correlation.
Pearl, however, was dealing with cities which were all sufficiently
large to offer practically complete opportunities for contact
infection, and the two reports, therefore, cannot be justly compared.
Winslow and Rogers suggest as possible causes for lessened incidence
in rural communities either diminished opportunities for contact infection
or differences in age distribution and racial composition of
the different populations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let us consider in greater detail the fate of both rural and urban
individuals who had been recently drafted into the military forces of
this country. Almost universally the raw recruit was found more
susceptible to disease than was the seasoned soldier. A report by
Lieutenant W. D. Wallis from Camp Lee “shows that while those who
had been in the service less than one month constituted only 9.19
per cent. of the total strength, they furnished 30.11 per cent. of the
total deaths from influenza and consequent pneumonia. Furthermore,
it is shown that while those who had been in the service from
one to three months constituted 45.18 per cent. of the camp, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>furnished 46.24 per cent. of deaths. On the other hand, those who
had been in the service more than three months constituted 46.63
per cent. of the population and furnished only 23.69 per cent. of deaths.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lieutenant Wallis says: “These figures show a much greater percentage
of deaths for the first month in camp than the corresponding
proportion of the population would warrant; while in the period of
three months or more of service the percentage is less than half of that
of the camp population having this length of service. The only
approach to a correspondence is in the period from one to three
months where the respective percentages differ but little. The increase
in length of service is accompanied by a progressive decrease
in the percentage of deaths from 30.11 per cent. to 27.41 per cent.
to 18.87 per cent., although only 9.19 per cent. of the population in
the camp falls within the class of less than one month’s service.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The incidence of mortality is in the first month’s service more
than three-fold the percentage of the number of men; and in the period
of three months or more of service is scarcely more than half of the
percentage of the number of men of the camp in that group.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The fact that the case mortality is higher among those who came
from rural homes than among those who came from cities seems to hold
even after three month’s of service, or more.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Vaughan and Palmer found that the case fatality at Camp Dix
among those who came from cities with a population of 10,000 or more
was 10.8; while among those who came from more rural homes the
rate was 15.8, although the average service of both groups was the
same.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Camp Surgeon of Camp Grant concluded from his records
that the new recruit is more susceptible to influenza and is more apt
to succumb than is the man who has been trained and is accustomed
to Army life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wooley reports data collected from four Infantry organizations at
Camp Devens comprising 15,502 men. Of 9,559 men who had been
in camp less than five months, 3,575 or 37.5 per cent. developed
influenza, whereas of 5,943 men who had seen more than five months
service in the army, 1,033 or 17.5 per cent. developed the disease. He
concludes that the large number of recruits in the camp certainly was
a factor in increasing the disease incidence. It should be remarked
that Camp Devens appears not to have had any influenza epidemic
in the spring of 1918.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is to be regretted that we have not several reports dealing with
the same subject from camps where the disease was definitely recognized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>in the spring. Fortunately we have one such. Opie and his
co-workers have observed that the epidemic at Camp Funston, which
occurred between March 4th and March 29th, 1918, and which
attacked 1,127 out of a total of 29,000 men, involved chiefly the organizations
which had been at Camp Funston during six months or
more. At that time it seems to have infected all susceptible individuals,
and to have spent itself. Subsequent waves of influenza, four in
number, and coming at a little less than one month intervals, occurred
when newly drafted men were brought into the camp in April and May.
In these latter cases the disease affected the men newly arrived in camp.</p>

<p class='c007'>At Camp Funston, at least, the higher incidence in the raw recruit
appears to be explained in part by a relative immunity of those who
had been in camp a month or more, existing as a result of an earlier
prevalence of the disease. More abundant evidence would, however,
be necessary before we could deny a diminution of natural immunity
in the recruits, caused by the exposure, overwork, fatigue, and change
of daily routine. As V. C. Vaughan has remarked: “It appears that
natural immunity gives way before exposure, overwork and fatigue,
as was demonstrated years ago by Pasteur in his experiments on birds
with anthrax. Likewise, it is possible for human beings to have their
resistance lowered by exposure to unaccustomed environment, so that
although naturally immune, the standard of immunity is reduced to
the point where the influenza virus gains admittance and overcomes
the lowered resistance.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Race stock and mortality.</i>—The relationship of morbidity to race
stock has already been considered and should be borne in mind in a
discussion of mortality by race.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have seen how the natives of India suffered unusually from the
influenza, the total deaths being estimated at over 5,000,000 individuals.
A preliminary report from the Department of the Interior on the
mortality from influenza among American Indians showed that
during the six months period from October 1, 1918, to March 31, 1919,
over two per cent. of the Indian population died of influenza. The
mortality among Indians in the Mountain States, especially in Colorado,
Utah and New Mexico, was very high. For the Indian population
as a whole the annual mortality rate from influenza alone during
the six months period was according to the U. S. Public Health Reports
41.2 per 1,000, which is above that for the larger cities in the United
States during the same epidemic period.</p>

<p class='c007'>In both of the above races we cannot say that it was not factors
other than race, particularly living conditions, that resulted in the
high mortality.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>Winslow and Rogers found in Connecticut that the proportion of
influenza-pneumonia deaths was lower than would be expected among
persons of native Irish, English and German stock, but higher than
would be expected among Russian, Austrian, Canadian and Polish
stock, and enormously high among Italians. They suggest that this
marked difference in racial incidence may be very largely due to the
differences in age distribution of the various race stocks, the races
showing the highest ratios being those which have arrived more
recently in the country and which are made up more largely of young
adults at the ages which suffer most severely from influenza. They
further refer to the work done by Armstrong in Framingham, and
state that their results tend to confirm his conclusions in regard to
the Italians, as do the figures presented by Greenberg from the records
of the Visiting Nurse Association of New Haven. “It appears that
Italy suffered very severely from the influenza epidemic in Europe, and
Dublin has shown that the normal pneumonia rate of this race is a very
high one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We have rather more abundant comparison of the white and black
races in this country. Frost found in his extensive survey that the
case fatality was generally higher among the colored than among the
white population. A similar observation was made by Howard and
Love, who found that the case mortality for influenza and its complications
in the United States and in the American Expeditionary Forces,
in 1918, was for colored troops 4.3 per cent. and for white troops 3.3.</p>

<p class='c007'>These two series of observations are of great importance, for they are
about all we have describing case fatality rate. The majority of other
reports describe mortality rate only, and are therefore not complete.</p>

<p class='c007'>The death rate in the Army was higher among colored troops, but the
incidence of influenza, the rate per 1,000, was lower for the colored
race. “Considering only the southern states, the nativity rate for
influenza for the white was 247.11 and for the colored, 154.58. For
lobar pneumonia it was 10.77 for the white and 28.31 for the colored;
for bronchopneumonia and unclassified pneumonia 7.26 for the whites
and 11.43 for the colored. It seems probable that the negro is less
susceptible to influenza than the southern whites, but that he is much
more susceptible to pneumonic infections, either primary or
secondary.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Fränkel and Dublin have studied the racial distribution of 70,729
deaths among policy holders of the Industrial Department of the
Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, particularly with respect to
incidence among white and black. Normally the mortality from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>respiratory diseases is higher among colored persons than among
whites. In the seven year period from 1911 to 1917, influenza-pneumonia
death rates showed an excess of 72 per cent. colored males
over white males and of 56 per cent. colored females over white females.
During the period of the epidemic the situation was reversed. The
whites suffered from higher rates than the colored. While the rate
among white males during the period, October to December, 1918, was
nearly fifteen times as great as during the period 1911 to 1917; that of
colored males was only seven times as great as the rate during the same
seven year period. White females during the height of the epidemic
showed a rate more than sixteen times as high as the normal, while
colored females experienced a rate only nine times as high. After the
first of January, 1919, the excess rate returned slowly to the normal
figures. These facts are based on death rate only.</p>

<p class='c007'>Any comparison of race morbidity or mortality, to be of value,
must be based on observations of individuals living in the same climate,
in the same domestic environment, and in similar age distribution. It
is practically impossible to discover groups living under such conditions.
Howard and Love, perhaps, approached more nearly to such
an ideal in studying the white and black races in the Army, but even
in the military forces many factors are at play. Thus, the death rate
among enlisted men was highest among the American troops in the
United States (12.02); second in Europe (6.07); third in Panama (1.09);
fourth in Hawaii (0.55); fifth in the Philippine Islands (0.14). By
race it was highest for the colored troops (12.69); second for the white
(8.83); third for the Porto Ricans (7.80); fourth for the Filippinos
(2.84); and fifth for the Hawaiians (1.72). The authors point out
that while the native troops had higher admission rates than the whites,
the death rates were lower, which illustrates the point that the death
rate for this type of disease is lower in the summer and in the tropics.</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>An Intensive Study of the Spread of Influenza in Small Groups of Closely Associated Individuals.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>We have been discussing the disease under consideration chiefly
from the viewpoint of the statistician. The statistician, possessing
a wealth of information of a general nature, and from all parts of the
world, and armed with fascinating complex mathematical instruments,
is able to dissect the information at his disposal, and to reconstruct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>therefrom both facts and apparent facts of absorbing interest. To
him we are indebted for the bulk of our knowledge of the distribution
and spread of the influenza through metropolises, through countries,
and through continents.</p>

<p class='c007'>Like the aviator flying over enemy territory he acquires a breadth
of vision and a general perspective which is to a great extent denied to
those remaining on the ground. But also like the aviator, from the very
fact of his high position he loses the ability to recognize detail. The
small subdivisions in the enemy lines are slightly blurred and he can
distinguish the front line trenches in which most of the action is occurring
no more clearly than the reserve and support trenches. An Army
depending entirely upon its aeroplane reconaissance would find itself
helpless in combating the enemy. The aeroplane is useful, yes, it
could not be dispensed with, but never an opportunity is lost for
scouting parties to explore the enemy front lines; it is these latter who
bring back information as to the local strength and distribution of the
enemy, as to what particular divisions are in action, as to the strength
of the entrenchments, the enemy distribution within the trenches,
and finally what is most important, information as to the weak points
in the enemy’s lines, places at which we may concentrate our attack
with the hope of driving the enemy from its stronghold. Occasionally
a raiding party will return with a prisoner. He will be examined
thoroughly and may yield some valuable information. All such
prisoners are not dressed alike. We recognize that some belong to one
regiment and some to another. After we have extracted what information
we can from the prisoner he is incarcerated, if we may extend
our metaphor, in a test tube, and there he remains for future reference.
We do not believe that these individual private soldiers are the cause of
the war, but we do know that they are doing their share of the killing—that
they are doing most of the killing.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is characteristic of human enthusiasm and hopefulness that each
raiding party prays that it may bring back with it a general officer, a
field marshall, the one who is chiefly responsible for the enemy offensive.
In our own little battle with our invisible host we have long
since discovered that field marshalls here as elsewhere are difficult to
discover by raiding parties. But the raids are and should be made just
the same. They almost invariably bring back some new item of information,
and it is the experience of many wars that even though the
commanding general be never captured, repeated small or large
attacks following preliminary reconaissance, if diligently and valiantly
prosecuted under good leadership may win the war.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>In studying the life and habits of the influenza virus and its army
of secondary invaders, and the results thereof in small groups composed
of individuals as the unit, instead of large groups with communities
as a unit, we will be able to discover a certain number of additional
facts, some of which may have considerable value.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the study by the author of six selected districts in Boston a
special study was made of the occurrence and manner of spread of the
influenza in the household or family as a unit. The 10,000 individuals
canvassed were distributed through 2,117 families. Of these two
thousand odd families, 45.44 per cent. were visited with one or more
cases of the disease in the 1918–19 epidemic, and 27.25 per cent. in
the winter of 1920. Of these, 14.31 per cent. had cases in both epidemics.
In either one or both of the two epidemics under consideration,
58.38 per cent. of all families had influenza (see Table III).</p>

<p class='c007'>In this discussion of family incidence, as in our work on the incidence
among individuals, the question naturally arises as to the
reliability of our information and the accuracy of our results. We
have shown the close correspondence between our own results and
those of Frost, done on a vastly larger number of individuals. The
information for families was obtained from the same sources and from
the same individuals. The thoroughness with which the inspectors
did their work is indicated by the fact that in addition to the 2,117
families on which we base our results, only the records of 194 families
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>have been discarded for various reasons. In discarding the family
records we also discarded the individual records and such are, therefore,
for individuals above our total of 10,000. One hundred and fifty-four
of these were for families whose homes were in the districts
surveyed, but who were not at home at the time of the first survey.
These were omitted during the second survey, irrespective of whether
individuals were at home. In this group are also included a few in
which children were at home, but were unable to give reliable information.
Fifteen of the 194 families gave insufficient information, and 25
refused to co-operate. The small number in this last group speaks
well for the efficiency and methods of the inspectors. All families
accepted for tabulation co-operated to the best of their ability, and
we believe that the records are as accurate as this type of work may be
made.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Niven, in the work referred to by Carnwath, made an inquiry
covering 1,021 houses, with a population of 4,721. Five hundred and
three households or almost exactly one-half, were invaded in either the
summer 1918, or the autumn-winter 1918 epidemic. This proportion
of families is quite similar to our own, but it must be pointed out that
Niven was not studying the same two epidemics that we are discussing.
Two hundred and sixty-six of his total households, or 26.05 per cent.
were invaded in the autumn epidemic.</p>

<p class='c007'>Previous to the present time the author has been unable to find
records of investigators having used this method of studying influenza
to any appreciable extent. Certainly there has been nothing done
on the subject previous to the last pandemic. Since then Frost has
studied, as indicated in his report, family incidence to the extent of
determining the relationship to overcrowding and to economic status,
and Niven has studied family incidence with special reference to
immunity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thomas Sydenham, speaking of the epidemic of 1675, says that:
“No one escaped them whatever might be his age or temperament,
and they ran through whole families at once.”</p>

<p class='c007'>According to Waldschmidt, during the epidemic of 1712, in Kiel,
ten or more persons were frequently taken ill in one house.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1732, Huxam tells us that, “not a house was free from it, the
beggar’s hut and the nobleman’s palace were alike subject to its attack,
scarce a person escaping either in town or country, old and young,
strong and infirm, shared the same fate.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Metzger says that the influenza was so universal in March, 1782,
that in very many houses all of the inmates were attacked. On the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>other hand, Mertens did not believe the influenza a contagion during
the same epidemic for the reason that according to his observations
now only one, and again all, of the members of a family, were stricken.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1833, in Königsberg, according to Hufeland, parents, children,
and servants were frequently smitten with the disease at the same time,
so that strange help had to be obtained for the family.</p>

<p class='c007'>Parkes taught that, “Persons in overcrowded habitations have,
particularly in some epidemics, especially suffered, and several instances
are on record of a large school or a barrack for soldiers being
first attacked, and of the disease prevailing there for some days before
it began to prevail in the town around. Sometimes, on the other hand,
schools and prisons have escaped. A low, damp, ill-ventilated and unhealthy
situation appears to predispose to it, and in some instances, in
hospital patients, it has assumed a malignant character. In other
cases again, hospital patients have escaped; for example, the old
people in the Salpêtrière in 1837, when the younger attendants were
attacked.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Effect of overcrowding.</i>—The family or household forms a social
unit in which human intercourse is very close, and in which the
opportunities for contact infection either direct or indirect are manifold.
In addition to all of the opportunities which each individual
has for contracting the disease outside of the family every case in the
family exposes every other member many times during the day. One
of the first questions arising in a study of the disease in the family is,
therefore, whether the size of the family in and of itself exerts any
predisposing influence on the total incidence in any one family. Are
large families more likely to have a greater percentage of cases
than small families? We have endeavored to answer this question by
grouping together all families containing only one individual, all of
those with two, three, four, etc., and determining the percentage of
individuals contracting influenza in each of the groups. The standard
for comparison is the percentage of the total 10,000 who contracted
the disease in either year, or in both. 19.71 per cent. of all persons
canvassed contracted influenza in 1918–19. Reference to Table IV
shows that of persons living in families of one, 17.95 per cent. developed
the disease; of those in families of two, 18.46 per cent.; in families of
three, 19.96 per cent.; in families of four, 20.10 per cent.; and in
families of from five to seven, between 22 and 23 per cent. Families
of over seven all showed lower, but varying incidence of the disease.
As is seen by the table, they comprise only a small number of
families.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1920, 9.55 per cent. of the entire canvassed population contracted
the disease. The table shows that 7.69 per cent. of all individuals
in families of one contracted influenza, and between 10 and 12
per cent. in families of from two to five individuals. Above the family
of five the incidence rates again are lower and varying within wide
limits. The last column shows the percentage of individuals by size
of family contracting the disease in either or both epidemics.</p>

<p class='c007'>The average size of all families was 4.7 individuals.</p>

<p class='c007'>If we consider only those family groups having over 1,000 individuals
as being sufficiently large to be representative, we may conclude
that families of from three to seven individuals show no progressive
increase in influenza incidence with increase in size of the family.
But all the available evidence indicates that other things being equal,
the age incidence is a very important factor. Its influence will be
felt in the subject under consideration, and it will modify the results.
Thus, families of one or two are almost invariably adults; families of
three are very frequently made up of two adults and a child or infant,
while families of from five to seven will be more likely to have a high
proportion of young adults—the age period more seriously affected.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next question arising is whether those families, large or small,
which are living in crowded circumstances, are more likely to develop
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>the disease. Arbitrary standards must be chosen as indices of crowding.
We have chosen two in order that they may check each other.
The first is based upon the number of individuals sleeping in a bedroom.
Families are classified as follows: Maximum sleeping in a
single bedroom, 1; maximum sleeping in a single bedroom, 2; maximum
per bedroom, 3, 4, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second standard of crowding is based upon the ratio of the
number of individuals in the family and the number of rooms occupied.
One person living in one room is not crowded; two in two rooms, three in
three rooms, four in four rooms, eight in eight rooms, twelve in twelve
rooms, are not crowded. Two people living in one room four in two
rooms, six in three rooms, twelve in six rooms, are decidedly more
crowded. On the contrary, one individual in two rooms, two in four,
three in six, four in eight, five in ten, etc. have an unusual amount of
room.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ratios <sup>P</sup>⁄<sub>R</sub> are then throughout, ¹⁄₁, ²⁄₁, ½. These are used as
dividing lines. All families with ratios higher than ²⁄₁ are classed as
very crowded. Families with ratios above ¹⁄₁ up to and including ²⁄₁ are
classed as crowded. Families with ratios above ½ up to and including
¹⁄₁ are classed as roomy, and those with ratio of ½ or lower are classified
as very roomy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Classifying all families in all six districts according to these last
four degrees of crowding, we find, as is shown by Table V, that there is
a progressive increase in the proportion of families with one or more
cases of the disease, with increase in the extent of crowding.</p>

<p class='c007'>According to the standard first described we find as is shown in
Table VI that families with three, four and five individuals sleeping in a
single room show a progressive increase of incidence over those families
with but one or two per bedroom. This again is shown best in the
total for all families, but is borne out in a study of each district. These
statistics are however of little value for the study of the effect of
overcrowding, because crowded families are usually large families.
With an influenza incidence of 20 per cent. we would theoretically
expect every family of five or larger to have one or more cases. This
would amount to 100 per cent. infected families and such a state would
not only influence, but dominate the statistics regarding overcrowding.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>An objection will be raised, and justly so, that we have up to this
point been studying influenza in families irrespective of how many
cases there are in each family. Until now the family with one case
was classified exactly the same as the family with eight cases. In the
following classification we have taken first all families with a maximum
of one sleeping in one room, and sub-divided these into families with
no influenza, those with one case, two cases, etc. We have likewise
classified families with maxima from two to six per bedroom. For the
sake of brevity we will consider only the last column of Table VII,
influenza incidence among the individuals of the various classes of
families for both epidemics. Study of the table will show a correspondence
in the other columns. Solitary cases were more numerous in
families with but one or two per bedroom (27 per cent.) and less
frequent in families with three, four and five per bedroom, (23 per
cent., 18 per cent., and 20 per cent., respectively). The families of
six per bedroom form such a small group that here again they should
not be considered. Multiple cases become progressively more numerous
as the number of individuals per bedroom increases (14 per cent.
in families of one per bedroom, 29 per cent. in two per bedroom, 41
per cent. in three, 51 to 52 per cent. in four, and 45 per cent. in five).
Fifty-eight per cent. of families with a maximum of one per bedroom,
43 per cent. with two per bedroom, 35 per cent. with three, 31 per cent.
with four and 35 per cent. with five had no influenza at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>But here again, the fact that crowded families are usually large
families interferes with drawing any conclusions. A family with four
per bed room would generally be larger than one with two per bed
room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frost observed that, considering the ratio of incidence in total
white populations irrespective of housing as 100, and after adjusting
all groups to a uniform sex and age distribution, the ratio where there
were more than 1.5 rooms per person was 77, from 1 to 1.5 rooms per
person the ratio was 94, and for individuals averaging less than one
room per person it was 117. <i>The attack rate showed a consistent
increase as the number of rooms per person decreased.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Woolley observed, “Housing, if one includes in the term overcrowding,
has surely been an important factor in spreading the epidemic.
Whether it has had any appreciable effect upon the incidence
of complications is a question. The epidemic has certainly gone faster
and was over sooner because of the crowding; the hospital was filled
sooner than it should have been as a result of the rapidity of spread
of the disease, and overcrowding of the hospital occurred when with a
less rapid spread it would not have occurred; but whether the number
of fatalities or the number of pneumonias was greater than they should
have been with less crowded conditions may be doubted.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>The housing methods in the cantonments and even in the tent
camps resulted in a degree of congestion and close physical contact
among individuals that was attained in no civil communities with the
possible exception of some institutions. In cantonments the number
of men in individual rooms ranged from 30 to 100 and even under the
best circumstances there was very evident close crowding. An individual
in any of these large rooms contracting a contagious disease
had opportunities to spread it by contact and by droplet infection not
only to one or two others, as in the case of the average family, but to a
large group of the men in the same room. A vicious circle was thus
formed which tended to propagate the disease throughout any camp
with utmost rapidity. Brewer has compared the influenza incidence
rate in the principal white organizations at Camp Humphreys with
the floor space allowed each man in the respective organizations, and
concludes that, “It is not proper or just to attribute the differences
shown, alone to the amount of floor space allowed each organization,
but it certainly points very strongly to the fact that the incidence of
the disease varied with the density of the population, although not
with mathematical regularity.” Brewer cites regiments which although
housed alike showed definite variation in the influenza incidence.
This merely shows that other factors also play a part. Thus,
in one instance, the difference in the two regiments was in length of
service. Brewer also found that among the white troops the incidence
of pneumonia appears to vary with the density of the population.</p>

<p class='c007'>V. C. Vaughan has reported on the relationship between incidence
in tents and in barracks at Camp Custer. From this one observation
it would appear that the incidence is little changed under the two
conditions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“During September and October, 1918, a study was made on the relationship,
if any, of influenza to methods of living. Of the command,
3,633 were in tents. The morbidity per thousand in these was 129.
There were in barracks 36,055. The morbidity per thousand among
those was 275. At first glance the lower morbidity of those in tents
is striking, but going further into the matter it was found that the
entire morbidity of the Quartermaster Corps was very low. Of the
Depot Brigade 2,881 were in tents, with a morbidity of 128 per thousand,
while 3,824 were in barracks, with a morbidity of 134 per
thousand.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Howard and Love offer three reasons why during the last four
months of 1918 the deaths from influenza and pneumonia in the
Army in the United States ran at a rate nearly three times as high as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>that among our troops in France: First, that the troops in the United
States were recent recruits and therefore more susceptible to disease;
second, that probably many of the troops in France who had seen
much longer service had had the disease in mild form in the early
spring; and, third, that the method of housing was entirely different
in France. There the men were spread over a wide territory and
whenever in rest area they were billeted in houses rather than crowded
into barracks. Furthermore, they were living much more in the open.
It was found that in commands of the Service of Supply, where troops
were housed in barracks with a large number of men to a single room,
the epidemic ran much the same course with high mortality, as it did
in the cantonments in the United States. The percentage of infection
and the fatalities from influenza and pneumonia in France were
much greater among troops of the S. O. S. than among troops at the
front.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Domestic cleanliness.</i>—We have studied the relationship between
influenza incidence and the cleanliness of the household by the same
method used in studying overcrowding. In Table VIII we have classified
according to cleanliness and according to the number of cases developing
in each family. We have had four subdivisions, “very clean,”
“clean,” “dirty,” and “very dirty.” There is greater opportunity for
erroneous results in this table than in the one preceding because the
standards of cleanliness are difficult to define. As a matter of fact we
are guided entirely by the inspector’s own impression of each household,
as she examined it during her visits. The following is an
excerpt from the instructions given each inspector on this subject:</p>

<p class='c033'>“A few words on this subject may describe much. State of
cleanliness of the individual, slovenly condition, dust and
dirt, foulness of air noticed on first entering, condition of
children, of kitchen sink, etc., should be noticed, and good or
bad features recorded. In the poorer districts not a few
families will be found in which the cleanliness, considering the
surroundings, is quite laudable. Of particular importance
are amount of daylight, ventilation, care of bathroom and
toilet, garbage, whether windows are kept open at night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the basis of these returns we have classified the families as
indicated, but each inspector was governed to a certain extent by the
average cleanliness of her district, and it is difficult to compare the
cleanest tenement with any of the districts of well-to-do individuals.
We will therefore probably find it more profitable and more nearly
accurate to combine the groups and classify them only as “clean” and
“dirty.”</p>

</table>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>But even without combining in this way, the table shows us that
for both years 27 per cent. of the very clean families, 26 per cent. of the
clean, 23 per cent. of the dirty and 21 per cent. of the very dirty,
had but one case, while 25 per cent. of the very clean, 32 per cent. of the
clean, 40 per cent. of the dirty, and 40 per cent. of the very dirty,
had multiple cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cleaner the family the less is the likelihood of multiple cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is rather difficult to find concrete examples of the influence of
domestic habits and environment in the 1918 pandemic. The remarkably
high incidence among the natives of India and among the American
Indians might by some be attributed to unfavorable environment.
Lynch and Cumming obtained records from a large number of institutions
and from business concerns having their own records, and
discovered that the influenza incidence was higher in those institutions
where dish washing was done manually than in those in which
mechanical washing was performed. They appear to conclude that
the difference in the two methods of washing dishes was the cause for
the greater incidence in influenza, thus bearing out their theory of
the propagation of influenza chiefly through eating utensils. On the
contrary it is possible that the presence of the mechanical washer is an
indication of advanced methods, greater care in the kitchen, and
better hygiene probably not only in the kitchen and dining room, but
throughout the institution.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Economic status.</i>—Although in our survey information has been
obtained regarding the economic status of the various families we
would not stress this phase of our subject. Obviously the amount of
money an individual has in his bank will not directly influence the
amount of influenza he will have in his home. As nearly an accurate
classification by wealth is by the separation into the districts, Districts
I and III being very poor, District II poor, Districts IV and V moderate,
and VI well-to-do. From Chart XXVI we see no definite
relationship between influenza incidence and economic status.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Niven has had similar experiences. He remarks that the
disease does not appear to have affected especially any class or section
of the community. Rich and poor suffered alike. Inquiry in some
towns shows that the epidemic not infrequently started in the well-to-do
districts and only later involved the poorer and less prosperous
areas.</p>

<p class='c007'>We cannot state with any degree of accuracy in what section of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>Boston the 1920 recurrence first began. The sections studied are for
relatively small portions of the city, and it is possible or probable that
the original increase was in some area outside of our districts. In the
districts studied the earliest increase in reported cases was from the
section of the city known as Dorchester (Districts IV and V), where
there was some increase in December, 1919. The latest definite
increase was in the Irish district of South Boston. Geographically
these two areas are quite near. The relative insusceptibility of the
Irish population is probably a much more important factor in the
difference.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frost found after classifying the white population canvassed in
Little Rock and San Antonio according to economic status, and adjusting
the incidence rate in each group to a uniform sex and age distribution,
that the ratios of incidence in each economic group to incidence
in total white population did show an increase with increasing poverty.
“Notwithstanding that the classification according to economic status
is a very loose one, based solely on the judgment of inspectors with
widely different standards, a considerably higher incidence is shown in
the lower as compared to the higher economic group.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Parsons, in 1891, discussed the influence of poverty, but believed
that it is the concomitants of poverty which were the cause of the
higher incidence among the poor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sanitary conditions do not seem to have had any influence in
determining the occurrence of influenza, and what share they have had
in determining its extent or fatality cannot yet be decided. On the
occasion of the last great epidemic, Dr. Peacock concluded, ‘The
more common predisponents to disease, <i>e.g.</i>, defective drainage, want
of cleanliness, overcrowding, impure air, deficient clothing, innutritious
or too scanty food, powerfully conduce to the prevalence and fatality
of influenza.’ And Dr. Farr showed that in the last six weeks of
1847, while in the least unhealthy districts of London the annual rate
of mortality was raised from a mean rate of twenty per 1,000 to
thirty-eight, in the unhealthiest districts it was raised from a mean
rate of twenty-seven to sixty-one.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That overcrowding and impure air must have a powerful influence
in aiding the development of the epidemic follows from what we
have seen of its greater prevalence among persons associated together
in a confined space; and though rich and poor have alike been sufferers
from the epidemic, and even royal personages have been fatally
attacked by it, it cannot be doubted that poverty must have in many
cases conduced to a fatal issue in persons, who, if placed under more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>favorable circumstances, might have recovered, seeing that it often
involves not only inferior conditions of lodgment, but also want of
appropriate food, of sufficient warmth and clothing, and of ability to
take the needed rest.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Distribution of the disease through the household.</i>—During the
autumn and winter epidemic of 1918 there was considerable discussion,
and particularly were there popular newspaper reports of entire
families being taken ill with influenza, sometimes all on the same day.
This was less true of 1920. But few of us are personally acquainted
with such instances and at best they must have been relatively rare.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among 1,236 families with influenza in either epidemic we found
only 94 or 7.6 per cent. in which the entire family contracted the
disease. No family consisting of over seven individuals was reported
as having all the members of the family sick in either epidemic. Over
two-thirds of the families with even numbers of individuals (464 out of
605) suffered the illness of less than half of the household. One
quarter of all families of more than one (539 out of 2,107) had but one
case per family. Over a third of all families of over two individuals
(745 out of 2,006) had two or less cases per household. <i>As a rule there
were at least one and usually several individuals in each household who
did not contract influenza.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>That as a rule the disease did not appear explosively in a family;
but that cases developed successively, is indicated by the fact that out
of 577 families contracting influenza in the epidemic of 1920 the
cases were all of simultaneous development in but fifteen. In thirteen
of these, two individuals fell ill on the same day and no subsequent
cases developed. In the other two families three individuals came
down on the first day and no other cases developed. In addition there
were, out of the 577 families, fourteen in which there were two or more
cases developing on the first day of the invasion, but which were followed
on subsequent days by later cases in the same family. Again, there
were eleven families in which two or more cases occurred simultaneously
at an interval of one or more days after the development of a
single prior case.</p>

<p class='c007'>We may say that <i>as a rule in the 1920 epidemic, cases of influenza
developed in families successively and not simultaneously</i>. In only 29,
or 5 per cent. of the families contracting the disease in 1920, did more
than one case develop on the first day of the appearance of the disease
in the family.</p>

<p class='c007'>A certain difficulty in determining the date of onset is that we
must rely upon the patient’s statement. One individual may have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>sick for hours or days before a second member coming down with the
disease called forth recognition of the fact that they both had it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unfortunately we are not able to give similar statistics for the
1918–19 epidemic. Our investigation occurred so long after the epidemic
that specific dates of onset of the disease would have been
entirely unreliable. The nearest date we have attempted to obtain
was the month of the attack.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. A. L. Mason states that 63 cases came under his observation in
the epidemic of 1889 as occurring in groups in families. In but six
instances were two persons attacked on the same day. The average
interval between cases in the same household was four days. Sometimes
a week or more elapsed. Whole families were never stricken at
once.</p>

<p class='c007'>Parsons in 1891 concluded from the results of questionaires sent
to physicians that in the first spread, 1889–90, there was an interval
between cases in individual households just as we have described.
Among the replies to his questionaires nine described intervals of one
day and under, six described intervals of two days, three of three days,
three of four days, and four replies described intervals of more than
four days.</p>

<p class='c007'>Leichtenstern observed likewise: “In large families the contagious
character of influenza is evidenced by the fact that the other members
of the family become sick one after the other following the first case.
This rule of succession is most easily seen in the early or late period of
an epidemic and is less noticeable at the height, where the opportunity
for all the members of the family to acquire the influenza outside the
home is enormous. This latter fact explains why, when all sicken at
once, the disease appears to be miasmatic in origin. There are many
examples where other members of a family living with a sick individual
remained unaffected. Parsons reports such cases, and this was so
frequently the case that some British physicians state that it is the
rule that there is but one case in a family or that the cases are widely
separated in time. This was only partly true during the period of
the pandemic and was very frequent in the epidemic following it. In
this respect influenza acts like the common contagious diseases,
diphtheria, scarlet fever, measles, etc., while the difference lies in
the short incubation period and the very high contagiousness of the
disease.”</p>

<p class='c007'>That West, in England, had observed the same phenomenon is indicated
by the following quotation: “How is it, for instance, that one
member of a household may be picked out and the others escape,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>though they are susceptible, as is shown by their acquiring the disease
shortly after in some other way?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again Leichtenstern wrote: “It is noteworthy that influenza on
ships usually did not occur explosively, but spread gradually, and on
ships usually lasted several weeks, as on the Bellerophon, from the
27th of March to the 30th of April; on the Canada from the 11th of
April to the 24th of May; on the Comus from the 10th of April to the
3d of May.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The German Marine Report states, ‘Everywhere on the ships the
disease began not suddenly but gradually.’ The frigate Schwalbe
first had a large number of cases only on the 6th day after the beginning
of the epidemic. There are, however, some exceptions, where the
disease has begun suddenly with the greatest violence on ships as on
land. Such was true of the frigate Stag which on the 3d of April,
1833, neared the influenza infected coast of Devonshire, and as it
came under the land wind the epidemic suddenly broke out with
great violence. Within two hours forty men took sick. Within six
hours the number had increased to sixty. Within twenty-four hours
160 men were sick. As Parkes has remarked the evidence is insufficient
that there had been no communication with the coast. There
have been other examples of sudden outbreaks on ships, as on a Dutch
frigate in the harbor of Mangkassar, where 144 men out of 340 took
sick in a few days (1856); on the Canopus (1837) in the harbor of
Plymouth, where on the 15th of February three-fourths of the men
took sick with influenza.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Garvie, in reporting his personal experiences with influenza in 1918
in an industrial area in England, experiences not based on statistical
study, concludes that there are two types of cases, the sporadic case
which occurs mainly among the wage-earning members of the family
and has little tendency to affect other members of the household, and
second, the type of case where a large number of individuals in the
household are affected. He called this the “household wave.” If
we interpret him aright he really means that there are either single
or multiple cases, and that the single cases are more apt to occur in the
wage-earner, the individual who is more exposed on the outside of the
household. He also believes that the household wave is more severe
in character than the so-called sporadic case, and is accompanied by a
greater number of complications.</p>

<p class='c007'>Armstrong, in his survey in Framingham, examined influenza
convalescents. He found that of these 10 per cent. were in families
in which no other cases had developed, and 87 per cent. were in families
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>where one or more additional cases had occurred. In three per cent.
information was lacking.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is important in studying the literature on this subject to distinguish
between definitely established fact and less definite description.
Thus one is still left in some doubt when one reads in a London
letter in the Journal of the American Medical Association for 1915
concerning the epidemic in London at that time that, “whenever it
has seized an individual it has usually run through the entire household.
Whole offices have succumbed.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The first case in the family.</i>—Chart XXVII shows clearly that in
both epidemics in our experience the wage-earner was much more
frequently the first case in a family than was any other occupation.
The individuals whose occupations kept them at home were second.
Infants, as was to be expected, were recorded as being “first case” in
the smallest number of instances.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1889 the distribution was practically the same. Parsons found
that out of 125 households the first case was a bread-winner in 96;
a housekeeper in nine; a child at school in thirteen; a child not at school
in two families. In the last five families the first case was in adults,
occupation not given. This order is identical with our own. Neither
our own observations nor those of Parsons consider the relative proportions
of wage earners in the population as a whole. The results
are nevertheless suggestive.</p>

<p class='c007'>H. F. Vaughan reached comparable results for the 1920 epidemic
in Detroit. During the first few weeks the age groups from 20 to 29
showed a relatively much more frequent influenza incidence than did
children up to ten years. In later weeks of the epidemic there was a
relative increase in the incidence among children and decrease among
young adults. He concluded that the disease first attacks the young
adult and from this group it extends into the home.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Local Government Board Report for 1891, H. H. Murphy
distinguishes three groups or ways in which the disease may be brought
into the family. The examples will be found to be characteristic for
any epidemic and for any country:</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Group A.</i>—Cases of single exposure.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Household 1.—Mr. Q. goes to London daily. Was ill with influenza
on December 25th. No other case in this house till January 15th.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Household 2.—Mrs. A. called on Mr. Q. on December 31st, and
had a few minutes’ conversation with him. She was taken ill on
January 3d. There was a Christmas family gathering at this house,
and this is how the other members were affected: Mr. B., January
6th; Miss C., Mrs. D., and Master D., January 8th; Mr. J., January

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Again, in 1890, Dr. Bruce Low studied the development of influenza
at East Keal, a town of 300 inhabitants. We quote in part his
description:</p>

<p class='c007'>“The following is believed to have been the commencement of the
outbreak, and for these facts I am indebted to Dr. Francis Walker,
Medical Officer of Health, Spilsby, R. S. D. Mrs. N., residing at East
Keal Hall, went to London (Forest Hill) on a visit on November 11th.
She visited Barnum’s Show on November 13th. She became ill on
the night of the 14th. Her symptoms were those of a cold, attended
with sore throat. No one else so far as she knew was ill in this way in
the house before her. She left Forest Hill on November 16th, still
feeling very unwell, and went to stay with friends at Kensington.
She was too ill to return home till November 23d, at which time she
was still feeling very weak. She heard from Forest Hill that, directly
after she left one of the inmates of the house where she had been visiting
fell ill with symptoms similar to her own. Within a few days,
probably about the 27th of November (the exact date is not fixed),
of her return home, her son, aged four, became unwell with what
appeared to be an ordinary cold, but the child had epistaxis; he soon
recovered, but during the next fortnight the four servants in the house
were ill with what were said to be ‘colds,’ one of them also had epistaxis.
On January 2d another son, aged six, was ill with ‘cold’ for a few days;
he went out and had a relapse, which compelled him to stay in the
house for another week.</p>

<p class='c007'>“On January 3d, Mrs. N. again fell ill with ‘a bad cold,’ attended
with headache, backache and epistaxis. She was in bed two days and
felt miserable and prostrate for more than a week after. On January
5th, Mr. N., her husband, had headache, backache, and general soreness
‘all over.’ On January 10th, the boy, aged four, who was first
attacked after his mother’s return from London, again became ill,
his symptoms being the same as before. The only other remaining
member of the family who had managed to escape an attack of ‘cold’
up to this date, was said to have felt ill the day the boy had his second
attack; but the illness of this individual was slight, and only caused
suffering for one night. Thus between the return of the mother on
November 23d and January 10th all the inmates of this house, nine
in number, had an attack of illness, evidently of the same nature. A
boy who works in Mr. N.’s yard was taken ill with influenza about the
end of November. He lives in the village. After his illness his four
brothers also were ill. Dr. Walker says that ‘about the end of November’
cases of like illness were beginning to crop up in East Keal.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Mrs. W., the wife of the village grocer and baker, who waited on
customers in the shop and never left the shop or house, was taken ill
on the afternoon of November 30th. Next morning, December 1st,
her husband and six children were all attacked in the same way with
what is now recognized to have been marked influenza. The only
inmate of the house who escaped was a youth employed to deliver
bread and groceries in a cart in the neighboring village.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Leichtenstern relates that a physician traveling from Berlin on
the 10th of December became sick in his home town, Elgesburg, on
the 8th of December, but he made several visits and a few days later
those people seen by him fell sick, while otherwise there were no cases
of influenza in the town or its neighborhood. These cases would
probably have fallen in Group C., of Murphy’s classification.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Intimacy of family contact.</i>—We have been able to discover in a
representative number of families in which influenza has occurred,
not only what individuals slept in the various rooms of the household,
but also what individuals slept in the same bed with influenza cases.
We can, therefore, study for the 1920 epidemic three degrees of contact;
contact by sleeping with a case of influenza; by sleeping in the same
room but a different bed; and general contact by being in the family,
but sleeping in another room. For brevity we designate these,
“<i>sleeping</i>,” “<i>room</i>” and “<i>family</i>” <i>contact</i>. We have established
similar information for 1918, after eliminating families in which deaths
or births or other additions or losses had occurred during or subsequent
to the 1918 pandemic, in which there has been a change of
address, in which the cases are so widely separated that we have
designated them <i>unrelated</i>, and finally, those families in which the
information has been insufficient. With the remaining we have
assumed that the distribution within the household has been the same
in both epidemics. Statistics are available on 1,734 individuals who
in 1918 were exposed to a prior case in the family. Of these, 462
developed influenza and 1,272 did not. 26.6 per cent. of exposed
individuals in families contracted influenza, without respect to the
degree of exposure.</p>

<p class='c007'>45.2 per cent. of individuals sleeping with cases of influenza in
1918 contracted the disease; 19.5 per cent. of those sleeping in the

<p class='c007'><i>Sleeping contact is more productive of influenza than are the less

<p class='c007'>Throughout this study the fact that there are multiple possible

<p class='c007'>Four hundred and sixty-three or 29.1 per cent. of the total of 2,193

<p class='c007'><i>On the whole there is no evidence of protection afforded by a previous
attack.</i>—Individuals who had had the disease before succumbed to a
second attack in the same proportion as those who had not previously
had influenza.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Recurrent cases.</i>—In certain families there were individuals who
had had influenza during both the 1918 and 1920 epidemics. Were
these recurrent cases the first ones to occur in the family, or did they,
as a rule, follow other cases in the same household? We have records
of 236 recurrent cases in which we know the order of occurrence of the
various cases in the family. Out of this total number 57 were the
initial cases in the household. One hundred and nineteen were the
only cases occurring in the family. Therefore 176 or 74 per cent. of the
total number of recurrent cases were either the first or the only cases
in the family. Sixteen recurrent cases followed between other cases
and 44 occurred as the last of a series of two or more in the household.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>SECTION V.</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Immunity.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>Opinions of all observers who have studied in detail the question
of immunity in influenza are remarkedly in accord. The conclusions
reached by Parkes in 1876 are valid today, and form as excellent an
abstract of our present knowledge as any produced since his time.
“There is some discrepancy of evidence, but, on the whole, it seems
clear that, while persons seldom have a second attack in the same
epidemic (though even this may occur), an attack in one does not
protect against a subsequent epidemic. Indeed, it has been supposed
rather to render the body more liable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1890, Abbott wrote: “There is but little if any evidence in
support of the protective power of one attack to confer immunity against
a second; and hence adults are not exempt, as they usually are in
epidemics of scarlet fever or other exanthemata; so that the proportion
of adults to children attacked in an epidemic is necessarily greater
than that which is observed in epidemics of other infectious diseases.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Parsons made somewhat similar observations: “One attack of
influenza does not seem to be protective against another; the disease in
this respect resembling diphtheria, erysipelas, and cholera rather than
smallpox, measles, or whooping cough. The duration of the epidemic
in a locality is so short that it is difficult to distinguish between second
attacks properly so-called, and relapses, which are frequent enough.
A case is recorded in the ‘British Medical Journal’ of February 15, 1890,
in which a patient who had suffered from influenza in France in
December, 1889, had another attack in England in January, 1890.
It was noticed in 1837 that many persons suffered from influenza
who had had the disease during the previous epidemic in 1834. The
shortness of the interval between these two epidemics, as compared
with that between 1848 and 1889, seems to show that the periodical
return of the disease in an epidemic form does not depend upon the
accumulation in the interval of susceptible individuals unprotected
against the disease by a previous attack. If one attack afforded protection
against another a large proportion of the population in 1837
must have been protected, yet an epidemic occurred, and on the other
hand for many years before 1889 a large majority of the population
must have been unprotected by a previous attack, yet the epidemic did
not recur.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“The persons now living who passed through the disease in 1847
are of course comparatively few, but such persons have not been
exempt from the present epidemic.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should be inclined to attribute the short duration of the influenza
epidemic in a locality to the establishment of a tolerance for the
specific poison among the persons exposed to it, similar to the tolerance
for dust possessed by workmen in rag factories, as mentioned, but
which is soon lost on their ceasing to be exposed to it, rather than
to a true immunity being established.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Relapses in influenza are of frequent occurrence; they occurred
in 9.2 per cent. of the cases at the Morningside Asylum, Edinburgh,
and in some cases indeed a second relapse has been recorded. The time
at which the relapse occurs is usually from a week to a fortnight after
the primary attack, and it can often be distinctly traced to an exposure
to cold, or return to work before complete recovery. The symptoms
of the relapse are similar to those of the primary attack, except that
they are commonly more severe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In his report of 1893, Parsons goes into the subject of recurrent
attacks in individuals in greater detail. He quotes several communications
received from various physicians and health officers.
These opinions differ, some believing that the disease predisposes to
another attack; others, that there is no effect on the incidence in
recurring epidemics; and still others believing that there is a small
amount of acquired immunity. The communications are not based
upon statistical evidence. He does find, however, an opportunity
for statistical study in the industrial schools at Swinton near Manchester:
“These schools were severely affected in March, 1890, 171
out of 589 children having suffered, or 29 per cent. In the first epidemic
of 1891 they were again affected, but to a less extent, only 35
cases occurring. At that time there were in the schools 449 children
who had been there at the time of the former epidemic. Of these
150 had had influenza in 1890 and 4 of them had it again, or 2.6 per
cent.; 299 had escaped influenza in 1890 and 17 of these had it now, or
5.7 per cent. Thus, so far as these figures go, an attack of influenza
confers a degree of protection which after the lapse of a year diminishes
by one-half the liability to contract the disease.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Leichtenstern, like Parsons, recognizes the importance of distinguishing
between relapses and recurrent cases. Relapses in influenza
are not common. They usually occur after the patient is up, and
about when he is ready to leave the house. These are not recurrent
cases, but in the epidemics in the years following 1889 there were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>plenty of well substantiated cases of recurrent typical influenza in the
same individual and some times even in entire families. During the
1889 epidemic, as during the 1918 epidemic it has been suggested by
various observers that the apparent immunity among the very old
was due to immunity developed as the result of previous epidemics,
such as that of 1837, 1847 and 1857. Leichtenstern has collected the
statistics from five different hospitals in which 8, 32, 35, 24, and 24
per cent. of individuals attacked in 1891–92 had already had the
disease in 1889.</p>

<p class='c007'>Allbutt in 1905 remarked that whereas he had previously believed
that immunity to influenza usually persists as long as six months,
many cases had recently been brought to his notice where such an
interval seemed improbable, where the succeeding attack was probably
not a relapse but a new infection. He has seen two attacks apparently
separate occurring in the same individual within two months. In
the same year Moore wrote that influenza shows a decided tendency
to relapse, a feature to which the indirect fatality of the disease is in
great measure due. “So far from establishing immunity, an attack
of this malady seems to render an individual more liable to contract
the disease upon any future exposure to its contagion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Again West, in the same year wrote, “From our present experience
we must conclude that influenza is infectious in a very high degree
indeed, and that the protection afforded by an attack is imperfect,
or of very short duration. Indeed, one attack seems actually to
predispose, after a time to another, or, to put it differently, that the
positive phase of protection is followed by a negative phase, in which
the individual seems rather more than less liable to succumb to infection
if exposed to it. It seems more likely that an individual may
never have influenza at all than that, having had it once, he should
never have it again. Some, indeed, seem to offer so little resistance
that they develop it regularly once or twice a year.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We have previously shown that the relatively low morbidity among
the older age groups in 1918 is not satisfactorily explained by an
immunity lasting over from the epidemic of 1889–93. If such were the
case the change in mortality rate in large groups of individuals would
occur at the age of 30.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the autumn of 1918 many observations were made, particularly
in the armies, of light incidence in those groups or communities
that had had the disease in mild form in the spring of the same year.</p>

<p class='c007'>Parsons quotes many similar observations for the period 1890–1893.</p>

<p class='c007'>V. C. Vaughan relates that at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, “there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>was in April a division of troops numbering about 26,000. An epidemic
of mild influenza struck this camp in April, 1918, and within
ten days there were about 2,000 cases. This included not only those
who were sent to the hospitals, but also those who were cared for in
barracks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This was the only division that remained in this country without
change of station from April until the fall of 1918.</p>

<p class='c007'>“During the summer this camp received 20,000 recruits. In
October, 1918, the virulent form of influenza struck this camp. It
confined itself almost exclusively to the recruits of the summer and
scarcely touched the men who had lived through the epidemic of
April. Not only the 2,000 who had the disease in April, but the 24,000
who apparently were not affected escaped the fall epidemic. It
appears from this that the mild form of influenza of April gave a
marked degree of immunity against the virulent form in October.
There is another observation which points the same way. Looking
over the statistics of the fall epidemic in cities in the United States we
find that certain cities had a low death rate, while others had a relatively
high rate. Among those cities which had a low death rate we will
mention Atlanta, Ga.; Kansas City, Mo.; Detroit, Mich., and Columbus,
Ohio. Going to the spring records of these cities we find that in
all of them in March and April of 1918 there was an unusually high
death rate from pneumonia and undoubtedly in these cities at that
time there was a relatively mild epidemic of influenza. In this way I
am inclined to account for the relatively low death rate in these cities
in the fall of 1918. I make no claim that this and other instances of a
similar kind prove that the mild and virulent forms of influenza are
manifestations of the same disease, but I do hold that the evidence
points that way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Lemierre and Raymond report the following observation in favor
of the development of a certain degree of immunity in the French
troops in April, 1918. After an intervening period of quiescence
there was a manifest recrudescence at the end of August. Many
military formations were attacked during both periods. This was
true especially in three groups of an artillery regiment under their
observation. In the first of these groups there were three cases in
April, while 114 men were attacked in August. In the third group
there were 100 cases in April and only 3 in August. In the second
group there were 20 cases in April and 59 in August. Their report
does not state the total number of individuals in each of the three
groups.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>Joltrain and Baufle discuss the flaring up of the epidemic in October,
and relate that a troop of soldiers from Indo-China nearly all had
the disease lightly in the spring, but when the disease appeared again
it spared this troop completely, while troops and civilians around
developed it in a severe form.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gibbon writes: “During the last three waves of the epidemic I had
to deal with the sick of 2,000 troops, and during this time we treated
in hospital over 400 cases. No cases admitted in June, July or August
were re-admitted in October, November, or December, and no cases
admitted in either of these two periods were re-admitted in February
this year. Unfortunately I am unable to trace the cases into March
as the troops were changed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Dopter reports recurrent epidemics of influenza in a French Army
Division in 1918. The division, of which he was surgeon, was one of
the first to contract la grippe at the time of its first appearance in the
zone of the armies at the end of April, 1918. At this time nearly the
entire body of infantry troops was attacked. The disease was mild,
and without complications. The regiment of artillery escaped nearly
entirely. This epidemic subsided very rapidly, and by the end of May
it had entirely disappeared. Early in August a group of heavy artillery
was attached to the division, bringing influenza with it. Then a
few cases appeared in the regiment of light artillery which had hitherto
escaped. By the end of August all three groups of this regiment had
been attacked. In this second epidemic the men who had come
through the first unattacked were very severely ill in the second.</p>

<p class='c007'>With rare exceptions those sick in the first did not contract it
again. Dopter notes that in the battery the most severely affected
in August, of which the effectives were reduced almost to none, only
those men were considered well enough for duty who had had influenza
in the first period. They escaped the second in spite of the close
contact with their comrades. The infantry regiments, which were in
close association with the artillery, remained unaffected.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, toward the middle of September new troops were attached
to the division, in view of an imminent attack by the enemy. These
troops, coming from neighboring and distant formations were suffering
at the time from grip, and continued to have the disease in the new
sector. Again, those attacked in May passed without damage through
this new epidemic. Among them there were only rare isolated mild
cases. The recurrences made only 1.6 per cent. of the total incidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Opie and his associates found that at Camp Funston after the first
wave of influenza in March and April, 1918, the succeeding waves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>usually affected only new recruits, who had not been in camp during
previous waves.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Calcutta influenza appeared as an epidemic in July, 1918, and
in November, 1918. During the first quarter of 1919, at Calcutta as
elsewhere, many cases were still recurring. Malone investigated the
incidence of the disease in three institutions of Calcutta: He found that
in the Gourepore Jute Mills where the population was practically
stationary, those individuals who were attacked in July, 1918, passed
through two later epidemics, in December, 1918, and February, 1919,
without contracting the disease a second time, in spite of intimate
contact with infected persons. The same was true according to
Malone in the Alipore Central Jail and the Presidency Jail in Calcutta.
He believes that his evidence strongly suggests an immunity lasting
for at least nine months.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dunlop found that Glasgow had a mild epidemic in the month of
May, 1918, in which the death rate rose from 14.1 to 20.1. There is
no record of any similar outbreak in Edinburgh. In the July epidemic
the Glasgow death rate rose from 11.7 to 15.9, while the Edinburgh
death rate went from 11.3 to 18.0, a higher increase. In the October-November
epidemic the Glasgow rate rose from 11.0 to 38.4, while the
Edinburgh rate went from 10.8 to 46.2. In the February-March
epidemic the Glasgow rate rose from 14.9 to 48.3, and the Edinburgh
rate from 18.9 to 52.1 In the July and October epidemics Edinburgh
showed a greater increase in death rate, while in February, 1919,
the increase in the two cities was the same. However, in this case
probably other factors play a part. Also, we must remember that
here we are dealing with death rates, not with incidence rates.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Inspector General of Health, in Spain, reported in January,
1918, that those cities which had the disease in May, 1918, suffered
lightly in the autumn of that year, while others of the large cities
which had been spared in the first invasion suffered most in the second.</p>

<p class='c007'>Maillard and Brune report an epidemic of influenza in an epileptic
colony. There were 32 deaths among the 63 cases. None of the
inmates of the hospital who had influenza during the June epidemic
contracted it anew during the October wave.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ovazza records that although a number of persons contracted
the influenza anew on its return in the fall after having had it in the
spring, yet the return cases were strikingly mild, and always free from
complications.</p>

<p class='c007'>Barthélemy describes the successive waves of epidemic influenza
at Bizerte. He found that the doctors and nurses who had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>through the first epidemic did not develop influenza in the second one
a few months later, even though they came in the closest contact with
the patients.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hamilton and Leonard have studied two successive outbreaks due
to lapses in a rigid quarantine in an institution of 180 girls between 12
and 18 years of age. The girls were distributed through six cottages.
In the first epidemic November, 1918, 76 girls contracted the disease,
at which time it was entirely limited to the occupants of cottages 2, 3,
and 4. The second outbreak occurred in January, 1919, when 82
took ill. Only five of these were located in cottages 2 and 4, the remainder
being in 1, 5 and 6. No cases occurred in cottage 3 during
the second spread. Both epidemics lasted a little under two weeks.
Those who had suffered in the first spread appeared to be immune to
the second. There were no recurrences. The second epidemic was
much milder in character. Twelve per cent. of the total remained
well throughout both epidemics.</p>

<p class='c007'>Dr. Niven, in his study of 1,021 households previously described,
found that 105 families suffered in both the summer and autumn 1918
epidemics. “They comprised a population of 565 persons, of whom
205 suffered in summer and 360 escaped. In the autumn epidemic
eighty-two (or 40 per cent.) of the presumably ‘protected’ persons
succumbed again, whereas only 120 (or 33 per cent.) of the ‘unprotected’
suffered. Of the former, however, only one died, while five
of the latter terminated fatally. These are interesting figures. If
they are borne out by subsequent inquiry, they are somewhat difficult
of explanation. The persistent susceptibility to the primary disease
and yet comparative immunity from the fatal sequel, would seem to
suggest a dual infection, against one element of which the body is able
to produce protection, while it is unable to do so against the other.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Frost made a canvass of 33,776 individuals in Baltimore between
November 20th and December 11th, 1918. The same population was
again covered in January, 1919, to determine the extent of the recrudescence
reported in December. Among 32,600 people, 724 cases of
influenza had occurred in the interval since the first survey. Of this
number only 26 or 3.6 per cent. were definitely cases of second attack
in the same individual. Even in these cases the diagnosis is necessarily
uncertain. Frost says that considering that 23 per cent. of the population
had had influenza prior to December 11th, the proportion of
second attacks should have been much greater if no immunity had
been acquired. A second canvas in San Francisco gave generally
corresponding results.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Our own experience was quite similar. We have divided the whole
period from March, 1918 to March, 1920, into two portions separated
at August 1, 1919. In the first portion we have knowledge of but four
individuals suffering from what the records would indicate to be two
genuine attacks of influenza. Similarly, five individuals appeared to
have had two attacks within the second interval. These are to be
contrasted with a total incidence in the fall and winter of 1918–1919
of 1,971 cases, and in the winter of 1919–20, of 965 cases. Among the
total nine individuals the intervals between attacks varied from 26
days to five months. All except one had an interval of one month or
over. In two cases there was an interval of one month, in one an
interval of two months, in two an interval of three months, in one of
four months, and in one of five months. None of the four individuals
who had two attacks in the first group of months had a subsequent
attack in the second. On the contrary, two of the five suffering two
attacks in the second group of months had one previous attack in the
first. The second attack, following the first by a relatively short
interval tended to be milder than the first. In five out of the entire
nine the second attack was milder, in two it was of the same degree
of severity, and in only two was it more severe than the first. The
order of severity in the two individuals having three attacks each
was, in the first, severe, mild, severe; in the second, severe, average,
average.</p>

<p class='c007'>Zinsser makes the following remark: “The writer himself believes
that he had three attacks during the last epidemic. The first and
second were mild ones and the third complicated and therefore severe;
and innumerable others with whom he has spoken have had similar
experiences.”</p>

<p class='c007'>From a consideration of these reports by divers authorities it is
reasonable to conclude that for a period of a few months at least, one
attack of influenza protects against a second. As is to be expected,
this relative immunity is not of constant duration in all individuals.
If there were no lessened susceptibility following an attack we would be
faced with the phenomenon of individuals succumbing time and again
to rapidly successive attacks of the disease. Such a circumstance is
very rare.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is difficult to determine how long even on an average this relative
protection or insusceptibility lasts. Evidence is fairly uniform in
indicating a protection of at least three months. Usually it is longer.
There seems to be some basis for the supposition that a group of individuals
exposed to an attack of influenza displays within the succeeding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>three months, or slightly longer, a relative general group immunity.
If the group be considered as a whole those even who did not develop
the disease previously appear to have become less susceptible.
Whether we can ascribe this to the individual as a unit, or whether we
must explain it by some assumption with the community as a unit,
is uncertain. Is it because the exposed individuals in the group who
did not contract the disease have individually received some of the
virus into their systems and developed a certain immunity, or is it a
much more complex phenomenon depending on greater relative dispersion
of susceptibles and other communal factors?</p>

<p class='c007'>We may place the minimum period of “immunity” at from three to
five months, rarely less. There is additional evidence by which we may
delimit fairly closely the other extreme, that time at which individuals
considered as a group no longer manifest increased resistance to the
disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>The author found that 19.17 per cent. of his population contracted
influenza in 1918, and 9.55 per cent. contracted the disease in 1920.
Two hundred and forty individuals, or 2.4 per cent. of the entire
population developed the disease in both epidemics. Out of 1,971
individuals having the disease in the 1918 spread, 240, or 12.1 per
cent. recurred in 1920. This is to be compared with the total 1920
incidence of 9.55 per cent. More correctly we should separate the
1920 cases into two groups, those who had and who had not had
influenza previously. The former group, 240 individuals, constitute
as just stated, 12.1 per cent. of all who had had the disease previously.
The second group, 715 individuals, constitute 8.9 per cent. of the
8,034 who had not had the disease in 1918–19.</p>

<p class='c007'>From these results we must conclude that <i>a previous attack contracted
on an average of from 10 to 17 months before, conferred no protection
whatever against a second attack. On the contrary, the attack
rate was slightly higher in this group than in those who had not previously
had the disease.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Yet another evidence of the insignificant part played by any immunity
in the occurrence of influenza in individuals in 1920 is indicated by
our series of 319 infants living in 1920 but who had not been born during
the 1918 spread and who were presumably not immune to the
disease. We have not investigated whether the mothers had had the
disease in 1918. From among these 319 infants, thirty or 10 per cent.,
developed the disease in 1920. This is practically the same percentage
as for the population at large.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>These findings also correspond with our previously recorded conclusion
made after studying the disease incidence with three increasing
degrees of exposure, <i>sleep</i>, <i>room</i> and <i>family</i> (page <a href='#Page_198'>198</a>).</p>

<p class='c007'>Altho we find no conclusive evidence of protection against recurrent
attacks, we do find (Table IX) that the second attack in the same
individual was usually milder. However, the 1920 epidemic as a
whole was milder, (Chart XVIII).</p>

<p class='c007'>Zinsser quotes a letter from Frost in which the latter states that
in Baltimore those persons who were attacked during the 1918–19
epidemic showed no relative immunity during the epidemic of 1920.
This is not a contradiction to the earlier Baltimore studies, since in that
case the interval between the epidemic waves was not more than about
three months.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jordan and Sharp have obtained statistics regarding approximately
4,000 men at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station. The
men’s statement regarding previous influenza was accepted whenever
the attack was said to have occurred during the influenza period of
1918–1919, <i>i.e.</i>, in September, October, November, December, January,
February and March. The great majority were reported for the period
of September to December. Only a few cases were reported as occurring
in March, and perhaps these actually occurred somewhat earlier
than the men recalled. A few cases were accepted as influenza when
reported as occurring in Europe during July and August, 1918.</p>

<p class='c007'>They found that 28.5 per cent. of 3,905 men had had the disease in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>1918, and that 22.6 per cent. were attacked in 1920. Of those who had
the disease in 1918–19, 21.2 per cent. had a repeated attack in 1920,
while of those who had not had a previous attack, 23.1 per cent. were
attacked in 1920.</p>

<p class='c007'>A similar study among 2,472 men at Camp Grant showed that 15.8
per cent. had had influenza in 1918–19, and 11.7 per cent. in 1920. Of
those with previous influenza history 15.6 per cent. had a repeated
attack, while of the remainder without previous history of influenza
10.9 per cent. were attacked in 1920. They conclude that no marked
immunity to influenza exists 12 to 15 months after a previous attack,
but that the results do not show that some degree of immunity may
not obtain at an earlier period.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is interesting while considering the subject of immunity to pay
particular attention to those who <i>did not</i> develop the disease as well as
to those who did. In our series 70 per cent. of all individuals escaped
the disease in both epidemics. With some variation this figure will
hold for all communities. Or, again, among those who had the disease
in 1920, 75 per cent. <i>had not had it</i> in the preceding waves.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hall states that in Copenhagen at the Bispebjaerg Hospital, among
the 500 patients with influenza in the four weeks early in 1920, 91.8
per cent. <i>had not had</i> the influenza during the 1918–19 epidemic.
H. F. Vaughan found in a review of 2,500 cases occurring in Detroit
in January, 1920, that <i>84 per cent. had never had</i> the influenza before.
The true significance of these figures cannot be recognized, because
we are not informed as to the per cent. of these populations attacked
in 1918–19.</p>

<p class='c007'>We observed such a universal distribution of influenza during the
epidemic period that it is frequently assumed that all individuals are
exposed to the disease, that the virus must enter the body of all or
nearly all, and that it is due chiefly to a relative natural immunity that
some do not fall victims. Is this the actual state, or is it true that the
distribution of the virus is limited to about one-third of the population
and that practically all of those who are actually exposed develop the
disease? These are the two extremes; more probably the actual
state is somewhere between.</p>

<p class='c007'>This question cannot be definitely answered, and yet it is one of
extreme importance, particularly with regard to prevention and combat
of the disease. How universally is the influenza virus distributed
during pandemics? What proportion of the population is actually
exposed by invasion with the virus? What proportion of actually
exposed individuals develops the disease? We will refer to this again
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>when comparing influenza with other infectious diseases, but it is of
particular interest now to review our individuals who were exposed by
sleeping with cases of influenza. Fifty-five per cent. of all individuals
sleeping in the same bed with cases of influenza in 1918 <i>did not</i> contract
clinical influenza. Seventy per cent. of all individuals sleeping
with influenza cases in 1920 <i>did not</i> contract the disease, in recognizable
form. Sixty-nine per cent. of all individuals in 1920 who had
not had the disease previously and who slept with cases <i>did not</i>
develop evidences of the disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is difficult to conceive of a degree of exposure much closer than
that of sleeping in the same bed with a sick individual. And yet it is
equally conceivable that many individuals sleeping in the same bed
with a patient were not penetrated by the virus of influenza. This
does not aid us in answering our question. We do not know whether
the more important factor is that of a natural immunity or that of
absence of actual invasion by the virus.</p>

<p class='c007'>These results with sleeping contacts form an interesting link in the
chain of evidence started during 1918 by the U. S. Navy and Public
Health Service, and reported by Rosenau and by McCoy and others.
These experimenters working in Boston and in San Francisco carried
out inoculation experiments on human volunteers. The work in
Boston, as reported by Rosenau, was carried on with 100 volunteers
from the Navy between the ages of eighteen and thirty, most of them
between eighteen and twenty-five; all of them entirely well, and
with the exception of a few controls, none having experienced known
attacks of influenza previously. First, suspensions of thirteen
different strains of influenza bacilli, all from cases of influenza during
the epidemic, were sprayed into the nose, eyes and throat of nineteen
volunteers. None of them took sick. Next, secretions from the
mouth, nose and throat and bronchi of acute cases of influenza were
collected, pooled, and without filtration sprayed into each nostril,
into the throat during inspiration, and onto the conjunctiva of each
of ten volunteers. None of them took sick. Some of this same material
was filtered through a porcelain filter and administered in the
same manner, with similar results. One cubic centimeter of each type
was administered to each individual. The interval between the time
of collection and time of inoculation was then decreased to one hour
and forty minutes, the minimum time in which the material could be
transferred from hospital to experiment station. The same results
were obtained. This time six cubic centimeters were administered to
each individual. Finally, transfer was made directly with swabs from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>the nose, throat and nasopharynx of one individual to another in
nineteen cases. None developed the disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next series of experiments consisted in an attempt to inoculate
volunteers with influenza by injecting into them 10 cc. of citrated
blood, which was the pooled collection from five cases of acute influenza.
Ten volunteers were inoculated. None took sick. Next, the
secretions from the upper respiratory tract of acute cases were injected
subcutaneously into ten volunteers, each receiving 3.5 cc. This
material was first put through a porcelain filter. None took ill. In
an attempt to reproduce the disease in imitation of nature, ten individuals
were exposed to cases of acute influenza in hospital wards.
Each volunteer was placed very near to the patient, shook hands with
him, talked and chatted with him, for five minutes, after which he
received the patient’s breath full in his face five times while he inhaled,
and finally the patient coughed five times directly into the subject’s
face. Each volunteer did this with each of ten different patients, all
of them acutely ill, none more than three days sick. No volunteers
developed the disease. All cases of influenza used throughout the
period of these experiments were typical acute cases selected from a
distinct focus or outbreak of the disease. Sometimes, for example,
they would select four or five typical cases from an epidemic in a
school with a hundred cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>In February, 1919, the experiments were continued at Portsmouth,
where the secretions were transferred direct from individual to individual.
In about thirty-six hours half of the number came down with
streptococcus sore throat, but not with influenza. One of the medical
officers, however, who had been very active in the experiments, and
who had come into intimate contact with the disease since early in
October, but who had not been inoculated, developed, during this
experiment, typical influenza. The explanation for these failures is
not certain. The experiments were started rather late after the onset
of the epidemic, and the volunteers may have developed some immunity,
although they had not developed the disease. Or, they may
never have been susceptible.</p>

<p class='c007'>McCoy made a similar series of experiments in San Francisco, using
volunteers who so far as known had not even been exposed to the
outbreak, also with negative results. However, many of these latter
had been “vaccinated against influenza” with a mixed vaccine.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wahl and his co-workers found that the nasal application of a
filtrate from the pneumonic lung of an individual dead with typical
influenza-bronchopneumonia failed to call forth any abnormal symptoms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>in human subjects. The application to the mucous membrane
of the nares and nasopharynx of five healthy men, who had been
inoculated from four to six weeks previously against influenza with a
polyvalent influenza vaccine, and of one uninoculated, of freshly
prepared suspensions of four different live strains of Bacillus influenzae,
even in massive doses failed to produce any abnormal symptoms.
The implantation of living suspensions of Bacillus influenzae produced
no material alteration besides the addition of the influenza bacillus
itself. When experimentally introduced into the nasopharynx of men
the influenza bacillus exists and multiplies for a considerable length
of time, two weeks or more. It apparently shows much resistance to
the action of dichloramin T.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>Influenza and tuberculosis.</i>—Following the 1918 and 1920 epidemics
of influenza, there has arisen in the literature some controversy regarding
the effect, if any, of influenza on tuberculous individuals. This
has centered particularly on the question whether tuberculosis produces
some degree of immunity to influenza, and whether the latter,
on the other hand, predisposes either to the lighting up of a latent
tuberculosis, or to a new infection with the tubercle bacillus. Keen
observers in the field of tuberculosis who have had apparently equal
opportunities to study the effects of the pandemic differ radically in
their conclusions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first mention of consumption following influenza was made in
1580 by Thomas Short.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the 1889–1893 epidemics, Leichtenstern recorded that the
mortality tables of all countries agree in showing considerable rise in
the mortality from pulmonary tuberculosis in influenza periods. The
clinicians of that time made the frequent observation that the course of
tuberculosis in the lungs is markedly and unfavorably influenced by
grip and its pneumonic complications. Latent quiescent cases often
became active, and healed and healing foci broke out anew. Afebrile
cases were changed to the hectic type and frequently hemoptysis was
induced. In London, during the height of the 1889 epidemic, the
weekly death reports from phthisis rose to double the average. The
increase in death rate during the epidemic period was not limited
entirely to tuberculosis, but there was almost a doubling of deaths
due to all acute respiratory infections. After the cessation of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>epidemic, however, there was some decrease in the general mortality,
as well as in the mortality from respiratory infections. This was
especially true of deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis, which decreased
to such an extent that the total mortality rate for the year for this
disease was little greater than for preceding years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Similar observations have been made following the 1918 pandemic.
Jordan remarks that in New York City in 1918 during the two weeks of
maximum epidemic mortality, the deaths reported from pulmonary
tuberculosis numbered 430, as compared with 264 for the corresponding
weeks of 1917. Vaughan and Palmer found that the deaths from
tuberculosis in the army were higher in the autumn of 1918 than in the
two previous four months’ periods, the death rate rising from 18 per
100,000 during the summer to 46 per 100,000 in the autumn. The
rate for the same time of the preceding year had been 15 per 100,000.
They assume that the most plausible explanation for this increase in
deaths is that dormant and incipient cases introduced into the army
during the preceding year had accumulated and possibly were hastened
into the acute stage, both by the duties of camp life, and the prevalence
of the epidemic of grip and pneumonia. Quite naturally there had
been from the time of the first assembling of troops an accumulation of
tuberculous individuals, inasmuch as such men were not discharged,
but were kept in the army and under Government control and supervision.
Sir Arthur Newsholme in reviewing the relationship between
influenza and tuberculosis in England concludes that many deaths
from tuberculosis are undoubtedly hastened during an influenza
epidemic. Abbott wrote of the epidemic of 1889 in Massachusetts
that the chief diseases which followed in its train and were intimately
associated with it were bronchitis and pneumonia, and that phthisis
when already existing in the victim of the attack was undoubtedly
aggravated, and in many cases a fatal termination was hastened.
Baldwin says that influenza is a frequent and important agent in
bringing latent tuberculosis to life. “Allowing for mistakes in diagnosis,
influenza must be classed as an important exciting cause, if not
a true predisposition.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In frank opposition to the foregoing authorities, Fishberg claims
that influenza has had no effect whatever on the course of tuberculosis.
He says that a large proportion of tuberculous patients under treatment
in New York City in 1918–1919 contracted the disease and not a single
one succumbed. This appears as rather an inclusive statement. He
goes on to say that some were in far advanced stages of the disease,
with large cavities in the lungs, and yet they passed through the acute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>symptoms and recovered, the tuberculous process then pursuing its
course as if no complicating disease had affected them. He believes
that the prognosis was, if anything, better in those who suffered from
tuberculosis or any other chronic pulmonary disease, such as asthma,
bronchitis, emphysema, bronchiectasis, than in those in whom the
lungs and bronchi had been apparently in healthy condition. Fishberg
observes that, instead of lighting up the tuberculosis, the influenza runs
a milder course than when attacking healthy persons, and the old lung
lesion remains in about the same condition as could be expected if no
complicating process had attacked the patient. He says that authors
who have asserted the contrary have based their arguments mainly on
the facts first, that many tuberculous patients date the onset of their
tuberculosis as concurrent with an attack of influenza; that many
patients suffering from phthisis state that ever since an intercurrent
attack of influenza the symptoms of tuberculosis have become more
pronounced; that the Pfeiffer bacillus has been found quite frequently
in the sputum of tuberculous patients, especially that derived from
pulmonary cavities; and finally that in some countries it has been noted
that during and soon after an epidemic of influenza the mortality from
tuberculosis was increased.</p>

<p class='c007'>He believes that many of the conditions diagnosed as influenza
have been no more than ordinary colds, and that the average patient
will call any upper respiratory tract infection grip during or around the
time of an epidemic. He further believes that a misdiagnosis of
tuberculosis is frequently made in influenza convalescents who show
some signs of moisture in their lungs which does not clear up for some
time, causing doubt in the mind of the examiner, but which is not
truly tuberculous in origin. Fishberg cites P. J. Murphy, Hawes,
Armstrong, McRae, and Dickinson, as well as Geiber and Schlesinger,
in Vienna, and Rickmann and Ladeck in Germany, as having observed
the same phenomenon of relative insusceptibility of tuberculous
patients and failure of influenza to hasten the progress of tuberculosis.
He also calls attention to the low incidence of influenza in tuberculosis
sanatoria, but apparently compares this incidence with the incidence
for the public at large, and not with that in similar institutions devoted
to the care of invalids with diseases other than tuberculosis, or with
other institutions in general.</p>

<p class='c007'>Amberson and Peters, as well as Minor, take sharp exception to the
statement of Fishberg, and the former have collected the evidence
against Fishberg’s view. They first point out that a comparison of the
incidence of 5.4 per cent. among hospitalized tuberculous patients at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>Chicago cannot be compared with a much higher incidence of the
epidemic in the various military camps. As Heiser has pointed out,
the mere quartering of men in barracks seems to have a tendency to
increase the risk from acute respiratory diseases. Furthermore, the
incidence at some sanatoria was low, while at others it was high, nearly
as high as for the community at large. In Hawes’ report of the epidemic
among the Massachusetts sanatoria, Lakeville had escaped
entirely, while Rutland which consisted chiefly of ambulatory cases,
less easily controlled, had an influenza incidence of 18.3 per cent.
among the patients, and 21.3 per cent. among the employees. At
Montefiore Home, the proportion of tuberculous patients and employees
contracting the infection was practically the same as among the nontuberculous
employees, and about the same percentage of both groups
developed evidence of bronchopneumonia.</p>

<p class='c007'>Still another fallacy in the comparison of incidence in institutions
and the like is proven by the work done by Jordan, Reed and Fink, who
found that in the various Chicago telephone exchanges the attack rate
varied from five per cent. to twenty-seven per cent., although the
working conditions were approximately the same. The attack rate
in one section of the students’ army training corps in Chicago was 3.9
per cent., while in another section particularly exposed to infection it
was 39.8 per cent. Similarly Frost found the incidence in Louisville,
Kentucky, to be 15 per cent., and in San Antonio, Texas, 53.3 per cent.
All these figures show the difficulty of comparing rates for various
institutions and various groups of individuals. Although Fishberg
quoted Rickmann in support of his contention that influenza has no
effect whatever upon tuberculosis, Amberson and Peters used his
work in support of their contention, and call attention to the fact that
in thirty out of forty tuberculous persons reported by him who had
contracted the grip, the attack did not produce any aggravation of the
lung condition. Presumably it did in the other ten. If even 25 per
cent. of tuberculous patients who contract influenza have their pulmonary
condition aggravated, this should be regarded as a notable
number. According to Stivelman, 11.4 per cent. of tuberculous influenza
cases died at Montefiore Home. In a survey of convalescents
from the Loomis Sanatorium, Amberson and Peters found that seventy
had contracted influenza, or 5.7 per cent. of the number surveyed, and
that 11.4 per cent. of these had had relapses of their pulmonary condition,
apparently due to the acute disease, while 22.9 per cent. had died
from the intercurrent infection. 2.8 per cent. were deaths due to
tuberculosis after convalescence from the influenza.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>Tubercle bacilli have been found in the sputa of convalescent grip
patients, whose sputa had previously been negative, by Amberson and
Peters, as well as by Berghoff, at Camp Grant. The latter found that
50 per cent. of his cases showed a reactivation and a positive sputum
after an attack of influenza.</p>

<p class='c007'>Amberson and Peters agree with Fishberg in the observation that
there has been no increase in the general mortality from tuberculosis
within the recent months, and suggest as an explanation the possibility
that during the epidemic enough of the old cases were carried
off to account for a temporary lull until new cases developed, or others
had time to reach later stages of the disease. As we have previously
remarked, Leichtenstern observed this same phenomenon following
the 1889–1890 epidemic.</p>

<p class='c007'>The state of our knowledge of influenza and tuberculosis is considerably
clouded by divergent opinions such as those quoted above.
To further complicate the picture, there are other authors who assume
a middle ground and believe that there is some truth in both lines of
contention. Thus, Amelung believes that the morbidity among patients
with pulmonary tuberculosis is slight, and that the grip takes a
milder course in such patients than in the nontuberculous, unless the
disease is far advanced, but that pulmonary tuberculosis may and
sometimes does follow the disease in patients whose lungs were previously
sound, and that in the last mentioned cases the prognosis is
relatively bad. Peck finds that in some tuberculous patients the
disease has been aggravated, but in the majority the intercurrent
influenza did not appear to have been the causative factor in the acute
exacerbation of the tuberculosis.</p>

<p class='c007'>Debré and Jacquet have reviewed the European literature on the
subject pro and con, and though they admit that there are exceptions,
as at l’hôpital Tenon, where, in a barracks reserved entirely for
female tuberculosis patients there was a veritable epidemic of grip,
29 per cent. of the twenty-eight being attacked in a few days; and at
the sanatorium de La Tronche, where 83 per cent. took ill between the
25th of September and the 20th of October; they conclude that as a
rule tuberculous individuals are less heavily attacked by the influenza
than are the nontuberculous. As they suggest, the first explanation
that comes to mind is that the tuberculous are isolated in the hospitals
where general hygienic conditions are good, but we have all seen other
institutions, hospitals, etc., in which the inmates were not spared as
they were in tuberculosis hospitals. Furthermore, in certain sanatoria,
such as the sanatorium of the Côte Saint-André, and Bligny, and several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>German sanatoria, the proportion of tuberculous individuals attacked
was very much less than that of the professional attendants, the
physicians and nurses. Again, where cases have occurred in these
hospitals, and little precaution was taken to prevent its spread, very
few other individuals took sick. Finally, many have noted the infrequency
of the disease even in those tuberculous individuals who
were living at home. It has been suggested that rest in bed from the
beginning of the attack explained the mildness, or that the immunity
resulting from the infection with pneumococcus, streptococcus, etc.,
in tuberculous individuals explained the absence of pulmonary complications.
Marfan, who observed this same phenomenon in 1890,
suggested that it might be due to a refractory state of the tubercle
bacillus against the virus of influenza. Debré and Jacquet conclude
that none of these explanations is satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having concluded that tuberculosis does protect in some measure
against influenza, Debré and Jacquet next discuss whether the latter
has increased the severity of tuberculosis in the subjects who were
already tuberculous. They review the literature and make their
conclusions, not from statistical records, but from general observations.
They consider first those cases of phthisis which are open cases
when attacked, and second, latent tuberculosis. Their conclusion
concerning the first group is that influenza does not have any effect on
the rapidity of evolution of the tuberculous process, except in very
rare instances, such as an occasional case of miliary tuberculosis
following grip. As regards latent tuberculosis, however, they do
believe that the intercurrent acute infection does cause in many cases a
lighting up of a previously entirely dormant tuberculosis. It seems
rather difficult to reconcile the two ideas. If one type of tuberculous
individual is rendered more susceptible to the ravages of consumption,
it would seem reasonable to expect that all types would be so affected.</p>

<p class='c007'>The greatest difficulty in reaching a conclusion regarding the effects
of influenza on tuberculosis, and vice versa, is due to the fact that the
individuals studied are in all stages of the disease, and that each individual
reacts differently and in his own way. Opinions have been
based chiefly on clinical observations, and not on statistical study of
large series of cases, while from the nature of the conditions, even
statistical studies would not be without great fallacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>Armstrong, found in a survey made in Framingham, Massachusetts,
that 16 per cent. of the entire population was affected with influenza,
but only 4 per cent. of the tuberculous group in the community.
Most of these latter were of the arrested type and were going about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>taking their part in industry and exposed to the same degree of contact
as was the case with the normal population. The fatality rate was
equally in contrast. Armstrong concluded that there appeared to be
a relative degree of protection for the highly tubercularized. If we
accept these figures at their face value we must conclude then either
that tuberculosis offers some degree of protection against acute influenzal
infection, or, that the tuberculous of Framingham have been so
well trained in sanitation and personal hygiene, as a result of the
Framingham demonstration, that they have been able to protect
themselves against the grip. In the latter case we must look upon the
result as a successful demonstration of the principles of preventive
medicine. Certainly this did play a part, to the extent at least that
individuals knowing themselves to be infected with tuberculosis, and
knowing themselves to be in the presence of a pandemic, became more
wary of crowd contact, and in case they did become ill, they undoubtedly
went to bed at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p class='c007'>If, on the other hand, this is a true demonstration of relative
immunity in a chronically infected individual, the explanation must be
sought elsewhere. Does a chronic respiratory infection confer a
relative degree of immunity to an acute respiratory disease? Do
the germs already on the premises exert, so to speak, “squatters’
rights?” Are we observing an example of non-specific immunity due
to local preceding infection? Still another factor may play an important
role, the factor of race stock. The excess of tuberculosis in
negroes, for instance, over that in whites, is in some localities double
or treble, while various observers, as Frost, Brewer, and Fränkel and
Dublin, report that the influenza incidence and mortality among
negroes was decidedly less than that among the whites. Winslow
and Rogers found that in Connecticut the proportion of influenza-pneumonia
deaths is lower than would be expected among persons of
native Irish, English and German stock, and higher than was to be
expected among Russian, Austrian, Canadian and Polish stock, while
it was enormously high among the Italian. Italians are notably
insusceptible to tuberculosis, while the Irish are much more prone to
infection with the disease. For example, in Framingham, where the
tuberculosis incidence rate for the entire population was 2.16 per cent.,
the rate in the Italian race stock was 0.58 per cent., and in the Irish,
4.80 per cent. In Framingham there was about four times as much
influenza among the Italians as among the Irish. Is this apparent
insusceptibility of certain race stocks an inherent condition, or is it
dependent chiefly on differences in living conditions and in age prevalence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>in the different races? Probably it is chiefly the former.
Frost, for instance, found that among the negroes the incidence of
influenza was lower even though the living conditions were much poorer
than those among the whites.</p>

<p class='c007'>Armstrong’s survey has also thrown some light on the effect of the
influenza on previously tubercularized individuals. In a survey of
700 individuals who had had the acute disease there were ten arrested
cases of tuberculosis, or 1.4 per cent. All these had been known to be
arrested cases previous to the epidemic, and in none of them did the
disease appear to have been actively and permanently lighted up.
Some had manifested a slight activity, but all seemed to be on the way
to a rearrest of the disease. On the other hand, thirteen cases, or 2
per cent. of the 700, were found to have active tuberculosis which had
hitherto been undiagnosed, and an additional eight cases, with indefinite
broncho-pulmonary signs, were designated as incipient tuberculosis
cases. This is to be contrasted with an incidence of active tuberculosis
in the pre-epidemic examination of approximately one per cent. These
figures would indicate an increase in tuberculosis incidence. How
may this be explained? The accuracy of these results will depend on
how the 700 cases were selected. If, for example, individuals who
feared tuberculosis because of known exposure, requested examination,
the results might be influenced by their inclusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has long been known that individuals with measles will not
react to tuberculin tests, even though they have been positive before
developing the measles, and though they will become positive again
after recovery. The same may be said of vaccination. Individuals
vaccinated against smallpox, who have measles, and are during their
illness revaccinated, will not show an immediate reaction. The test
will remain entirely negative, while after recovery, the immediate
reaction may be obtained. Normally, it will appear in 95 per cent.
of cases, while among those with measles the phenomenon remains
absent in 90 per cent. The same phenomenon is present in certain
other acute illnesses, particularly scarlet fever. It has been variously
explained. von Pirquet, who was the first to observe it in measles,
believed that the acute disease created a temporary inability to
produce antibodies, and therefore designated the condition by the
name “anergie.” The same phenomenon of anergie has been found
recently to hold in the case of influenza. Debré and Jacquet, Lereboullet,
Bloomfield and Mateer, as well as Berliner and Schiffer, have
brought forth abundant evidence to this effect, following the 1918
pandemic. It has also been shown by Cayrel and others that there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>a diminution of typhoid agglutinins in the serum of influenza patients
vaccinated against typhoid. The agglutinin titer again increases
after recovery. It is true that the agglutinin titer is not a measure of
immunity, but it is frequently used as such and serves to give us some
information on the subject. If, then, influenza is an anergic disease,
a “<span lang="fr">maladie anergisante</span>,” we have a theoretical explanation of the
increase in severity of tuberculosis following the acute infection. We
have long observed that tuberculosis frequently follows measles. We
have recently been thoroughly convinced that influenza lessens resistance
to secondary infection with streptococcus, pneumococcus, and
other respiratory tract organisms. Shall the tubercle bacillus be
added to this list? During the 1918 epidemic we saw men in the army
camps who passed through an attack of influenza-pneumonia and died
within a few weeks from tuberculous pneumonia or miliary tuberculosis.
These men had previously been so free from signs of their
tuberculosis, as to be accepted for military service as healthy individuals.
The number of these cases was small, to be sure, but
sufficiently large to convince us that there do exist instances in which
tuberculosis is tremendously fired by an intercurrent influenza.</p>

<p class='c007'>If we may judge merely by the balance of evidence and risk any
conclusions from such conflicting testimony, we may sum up as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Great variation in the interaction of tuberculosis and influenza
must be expected, because of the many stages at which the tuberculous
may be attacked, because of the altered mode of living of known consumptives,
and because of the protected life of most of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Phthisical patients as a group, may be <i>relatively</i> insusceptible
to influenza infection. This may be due to the tuberculous process
itself or to some extrinsic, but nearly related cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. But many individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis <i>do</i> get
influenza.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. And the disease, having been contracted, in many cases hastens
the fatal termination of the tuberculous process.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. It may be that this phthisical exacerbation occurs more frequently
in individuals with latent tuberculosis, individuals who are
not at the time mobilizing their protective antibodies.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Other infectious diseases.</i>—We have found diversity of opinion
regarding the relationship between influenza and tuberculosis, and
yet the latter, being as a rule very chronic and presenting very definite
signs which may easily be followed, should theoretically be a disease
in which the results of study would be quite definite. When it comes
to a study of other maladies we find the same difference of opinion
frequently present.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>It has been the experience of many that during influenza epidemics
other acute specific infectious diseases appear to diminish, both in
number of cases and in extent. At Camp Sevier, for example, two
measles wards had been quite constantly full of patients up to the time
of the fall influenza epidemic, while during the time of the epidemic one
ward appeared sufficient to hold all cases of measles. In the stress
of the epidemic this difference was probably more apparent than real,
and certainly is not to be taken as of statistical value.</p>

<p class='c007'>Vaughan and Palmer report for all troops in the United States
that, “Without exaggeration it may be said that for the time being at
least, influenza and pneumonia suppressed other infectious diseases.
Typhoid fever increased to a barely noticeable degree. The death
rate from this disease was somewhat higher, but the total number is
so small as to barely warrant comment, and not to justify any definite
conclusion. Scarlet fever and malaria were both lower than during
the summer. In fact, there was but one scarlet fever outbreak of any
importance and that occurred at Camp Hancock. Within two weeks
over 300 cases were reported and this marks the largest scarlet fever
epidemic that occurred in the camps in this country at any time.
Meningitis increased although it did not reach the prevalence of the
previous winter. The weekly incidence curve for all troops in this
country suggests that meningitis was in some instances a sequel to
influenza. The greatest meningitis incidence corresponds with the
influenza peak. Diphtheria showed no material increase. Deaths
from tuberculosis were higher in the autumn than in the two previous
periods, the death rate rising from 18 per 100,000 during the summer
to 46 in the autumn. The rate for the previous winter was 15.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1889 Abbott was unable to find satisfactory evidence of a connection
between influenza and other epidemic diseases, although as he
mentions, such connection had often been affirmed. Instances in
support of each position were to be found in the literature of the time.</p>

<p class='c007'>P. Friedrich, after an exhaustive study of the literature, following
the 1889 pandemic, concluded that there was no relationship whatever
between the incidence of influenza and other acute infections. Wutzdorff
reached the same view after studying the various diseases during
the influenza recrudescences and recurrences. Finally, Ripperger
concluded likewise.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be remarked that following 1918 there have been several
articles written concerning the relationship between influenza and
certain other diseases. These are difficult to correlate and in most
instances so many additional factors play a part that the conclusions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>drawn are perhaps not entirely well grounded. Sylvestri found that
in his experience malaria patients escaped the influenza during the
pandemic. He believes that it was the malaria rather than the quinine
which was responsible for the apparent immunity. On the contrary
others have observed, if anything, an increase in malarial patients.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fränkel and Dublin found that during the pandemic period deaths
from whooping cough increased. The difficulty of differentiating
between whooping cough and influenza as a cause of death is apparent.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems quite certain that deaths from organic diseases of the
heart increase during and following influenza epidemics and are due
probably to the inability of the weakened patients to resist the added
burden. Fränkel and Dublin found an increase in deaths from this
cause. This was also observed to be true in Spain and other localities.</p>

<p class='c007'>Jordan has compared the curves of influenza with those of acute
coryza among school children of Chicago and finds that the period of
highest incidence of colds in October, 1918, occurred in the second
week of school and that it preceded the corresponding period of influenza
by seven weeks. There were three peaks in the curve for colds
and only two in that for influenza. The period of highest incidence of
colds follows the first peak of the influenza curve by one week, while
during the week of greatest prevalence of influenza there is a sharp fall
of the number of cases of colds. The third peak for colds occurred
one week after the height of the influenza curve. As a rule the colds
curve runs at a higher level than that for influenza. A striking fact is
that the portion of the curve for influenza contained within the period
November 23d to December 7th, is almost the exact opposite of the
corresponding portion in the curve for colds. How much of this is due
to the factor of diagnosis is difficult to say.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Encephalitis lethargica.</i>—It is not within the scope of our report to
discuss in detail this disease. Its apparent relationship with influenza,
in point of time, if not otherwise, calls for special mention. In 1712 a
disease followed a pandemic of influenza, occurring particularly in
Germany, where it was known under the name of “Tübingen Sleeping
Sickness.” In the spring of 1890, according to Netter, a disease of
similar character called “Nona” was distributed especially in Northern
Italy and Hungary and scattered more or less diffusely over a large
part of Europe. Preceding the last influenza pandemic the disease
was first reported in Vienna in the winter of 1916–17. Cases were
seen in Paris in February and March, 1918, and the first official report
of the disease in England seems to have been on January 26, 1918. In
the spring of 1918 there were 168 officially reported cases in England
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>with 37 deaths. The disease seems to have disappeared there in June,
1918, and reappeared in the autumn of the same year. The first cases
in the United States were reported by Pothier at Camp Lee, Va. Following
the great influenza pandemic cases of lethargic encephalitis
have appeared in all parts of the world. It has been present in England,
France, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Greece, Italy, and other countries
of Europe, South America, Mexico, the United States,
Australia, Queensland, New South Wales, and Algiers. There was an
increase of encephalitis lethargica concomitant with the increase
of influenza in the early months of 1920. Thus, in Switzerland 440
cases were reported during February, 1920. The 1920 epidemic of
influenza in that country had almost ceased by the middle of March,
while that of lethargic encephalitis had greatly decreased. One
hundred and forty-one cases of the latter disease appeared in the
canton of Zürich alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is epidemic encephalitis a disease sui generis or is it a form of
influenza?</p>

<p class='c007'>The consensus of opinion has been that it is a separate disease.
There is, however, no way of telling how close is the relationship to the
influenza itself. If lethargic encephalitis is a sequel to influenza, is it
caused by the same germ? Flexner points out that in 1916, when the
first cases of encephalitis appeared or at least were recognized in Austria,
the epidemic of influenza had not yet appeared. In England, France
and the United States the epidemics of the two diseases were more or
less coincidental. He believes that little weight can be given the supposed
coincidence of influenza and the “sleeping sickness” of 1712, and
that it is highly improbable that the semi-mysterious affection, “nona,”
which dates from 1890 was definitely a sequel of influenza. He concludes
that the outbreak of encephalitis either antedated the pandemic
of influenza of 1918, or that the two diseases more or less overlapped;
that is, although probably quite by accident, they prevailed concurrently.
He prefers for the time being at least to regard them as independent
diseases.</p>

<p class='c007'>Crookshank believes that encephalitis lethargica is a distinct disease,
but that it occurs frequently as an antecedent of or coincident
with influenza, together with increase in the existence of poliomyelitis
and certain other diseases.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nevertheless the association in point of time and place between
influenza and lethargic encephalitis cannot be lightly overlooked. As
we have seen, Flexner’s criticism that encephalitis antedated the
influenza is not valid, because the latter was present in 1916. We
must await fuller evidence on this subject.</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>Comparison of Influenza with Other Epidemic Diseases.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>A certain amount of knowledge concerning the epidemiology of
influenza may be gained by a comparison of the epidemic features of
that disease with those of other epidemic diseases, particularly measles
and the exanthemata, meningitis, the plague, and certain diseases of
the lower animals. Influenza is described as a disease with distinctive
epidemiologic characteristics, the chief of which are found only in
epidemic spreads. Thus one of the fundamental characteristics of
these epidemics is supposed to be the primary type of wave, the wave
characterized by rapid rise, quasi-symmetrical evolution, and a concentration
closely grouped around the maximum. “This is found
in no other disease. In no other type of epidemic does the curve rise as
rapidly to a peak or fall as swiftly, nor is the epidemic completed in as
short a time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The secondary type of curve, that which is more frequently found in
recurring influenza epidemics, characterized by a more gradual ascent,
a still more gradual decline and a longer duration, is found frequently
in the curves for other diseases; it is much less characteristic. We
shall attempt by a comparison of epidemic influenza with these other
diseases to explain the cause for this characteristic primary curve, so as
to gain a further insight into the epidemic features of the disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are certain characteristics held by epidemic influenza in
common with other diseases. There are certain resemblances between
it and epidemic meningitis; in certain ways it resembles measles and
there are some points of similarity to the pneumonic form of plague.
The fact that it cannot be compared with one of these diseases to the
exclusion of the others renders deductions more complicated.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Epizootics.</i>—Soper has written at some length on a comparison of
influenza in man with the so-called influenza among horses. The
close resemblance in many features is striking.</p>

<p class='c007'>Epizootics of a disease apparently resembling influenza have been
described among horses from before the Christian Era. A disease
believed to have been influenza was recorded as having occurred B.C.
among horses in Sicily. According to Parkes the epidemic which
attacked the army of Charlemagne in 876 attacked at the same time
dogs and birds. Finkler describes an epizootic among horses in
1404 A.D. There were other epizootics in 1301, 1711 and 1870 to
1873. In 1901 a severe outbreak occurred in America, and one has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>also been described by Mathers as occurring in Chicago in the winter of
1915–16. These epidemics of a disease clinically resembling influenza
have frequently occurred among horses at the same time with true
epidemics of influenza in man. Nevertheless there has been no clear
cut evidence to prove that the disease is the same.</p>

<p class='c007'>Leichtenstern discusses the incidence of respiratory disease among
animals, particularly household pets during epidemics of influenza.
He comes to the conclusion that human influenza is a disease limited
entirely to the human race and having no connection with animal
disease. This is particularly true with regard to diseases reported
among cats, dogs, canaries and other captive birds. He also believes
that the epizootics among horses which have been reported from time
to time as occurring with influenza epidemics have nothing to do with
the disease in man. The symptoms are frequently very similar, but
epizootics have frequently occurred at times when there was no epidemic
of disease among humans.</p>

<p class='c007'>Abbott concluded that during the great horse epidemic of 1872
which bore a strong resemblance to influenza the disease was not
unusually prevalent among men except in a few limited localities;
while other infectious diseases, such as measles, small pox, scarlet fever
and cholera infantum were unusually prevalent in that year.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soper writes that, “Economically, influenza is the most important
disease of horses in temperate climates. The mortality among
remounts has been many times greater from influenza than from all
other diseases put together. It is estimated that over 25,000 horses
purchased by the British Government in America and Canada, during
two years of the war, died in those countries while awaiting shipment
to Europe. In a circular issued January 12, 1918, by the Surgeon
General of the United States Army to the veterinarians of remount
depots, it was stated that the losses from influenza among American
army horses amounted to over $100,000 a week. The disease spoken
of as influenza in the horse has many other names. It is commonly
called pink-eye, shipping fever, stable pneumonia and bronchitis.
By some influenza is not believed to be a single disease, but a group
of diseases. By others it is considered to be a definite entity, varying
in its symptom complex at different times and with various horses.
Infectious laryngitis and infectious pharyngitis seem to be independent
diseases. Two forms of influenza are generally distinguished:
catarrhal and pectoral.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Even after the last pandemic of influenza the question has again
arisen as to the identity of the disease among animals. Orticoni and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>his co-workers observe that there was an extensive epizootic among
horses at the time of the 1918 epidemic in the area which they had
under observation. There have been other similar reports. The
popular press, during the height of the 1918 spread, reported that there
was a highly fatal influenza infesting the monkeys of South Africa
and that the baboons were dying in scores, their dead bodies being
found on the roadsides and in the vicinity of homesteads. Another
report tells of the influenza decimating the big game in Canada, and
yet another tells of the havoc wrought among the buffalos and other
animals in the United States National Parks. These reports have not
been corroborated by scientific observations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soper has analyzed the subject of so-called influenza among horses.
He finds that the disease is quite generally distributed, that it has
many points of close similarity to the influenza of man, but that it is a
distinct and separate disease. The two diseases are not identical and
neither can be transmuted into the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Briefly, the symptoms, as stated in a recent publication of the
United States Department of Agriculture, are sudden onset; fever in
some cases preceded by chill; great physical prostration and depression
of nervous force; sometimes injected mucous membranes, especially
those of the eye, and loss of appetite. In uncomplicated cases the
fever abates after about a week and there is a general restoration to
health. Pneumonia is one of the frequent complications and is always
serious. The death rate varies between two and seven per cent.
The most usual form is the catarrhal type. The attack may last only
two or three days; in other cases the course may extend to two weeks,
in which event it takes the animal a long time to get well. Horses
which have passed through this form of disease may be considered to
have recovered two weeks after the disappearance of the fever.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The diagnosis of influenza depends as much upon its epidemiological
aspects as upon the symptoms. Law bases it on the
suddenness of the attack, its epizootic character, the numbers attacked
in rapid succession and over a large area as compared with ordinary
contagious pneumonia, the sudden and extreme prostration, the mildness
of the average case, the congestion of the upper air passages, the
watering and discoloration of the eyes, and the history of the case.
Points of interest in the history are the arrival of the infected horses
within a few days from an infected place, or coming through such a
place, or the attacking of new arrivals in a previously infected stable,
or the known advance of the disease toward the place where the
patients are located.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>Soper found that the progress of the epidemic of 1872–73 among the
horses in this country was as generalized, but much slower than the
progress of the recent pandemic among human beings, the rapidity
of progress corresponding with the rapidity of the transport of the
horses at that time. Just as we have found in the case of influenza so
also at that time the spread only followed lines of communication and
actual contact between horses.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is highly interesting that attempts to transfer the disease from
horse to horse experimentally met with the same degree of failure that
was experienced in similar attempts to transfer influenza experimentally
from man to man. In fact Lieut. Col. Watkins Pitchford
of the British Army Veterinary Corps in a report in July, 1917, stated
that it was impossible to produce infection experimentally. Nose
bags were kept upon horses with profuse nasal discharges and high
temperature, and these nose bags were then used to contain the food
of other horses without infection taking place.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are several other points of resemblance between horse
influenza and human influenza. The mortality from influenza among
horses is under ordinary circumstances between two and seven per
cent., and is highest in horses worn out by fatigue after a long railroad
journey, among fat horses out of condition, and among horses which
have been driven after they were sick. The death rate in the simple
catarrhal form of influenza rarely exceeds one-half of one per cent.,
while in the pectoral form it is never less than four or five per cent.,
and may reach 16 per cent. The only measure of prevention which
has been found wholly satisfactory is strict isolation. Usually influenza
occurs in horses who have newly arrived in a stable from elsewhere.
Practically all the newly arrived horses and country horses
are almost alone susceptible. Soper, who has studied the records,
such as they are, in the army veterinary corps, and also the records
from the Bureau of Animal Industry, concludes that they show nothing
to indicate that any general epizootic of influenza occurred among
horses during the year 1918 corresponding to, or connectable with the
pandemic of influenza among human beings. There was influenza
among the horses, but he does not think it was extensive enough to
be allied with influenza among human beings. He concludes that
there are two types of influenza among horses, first a mild form which
nearly all horses get when transferred to a contaminated stable, after
which there develops immunity, and the second type, a true epizootic
which may sweep the entire country, attacking practically every
horse. A most suggestive result of his study lies in the fact that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>predisposing influences play a most important part in the production
of serious influenza among horses.</p>

<p class='c007'>Aside from noting a certain similarity between the epizootic of
so-called influenza in horses and influenza as we know it in man, we
cannot acquire much additional information concerning influenza
itself from a consideration of this subject. The important conclusion
is that in several of the most important epidemiologic features the two
diseases are similar and that the study of human influenza may be
furthered by critical studies of influenza in horses. We shall attempt
to demonstrate that influenza in a similar manner is not unlike other
epidemic diseases.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Asiatic cholera.</i>—There are those who claim that the disease should
be compared with Asiatic cholera which remains constantly endemic
on the banks of the Ganges and at intervals spreads from there throughout
Indo-China, and formerly at times throughout the civilized world.
Those who compare influenza with this disease believe that this is
additional evidence in favor of a single focus of endemicity of influenza.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Epidemic meningitis.</i>—On the contrary the disease may well be
compared with epidemic meningitis. The germ of this disease, distributed
throughout the world, is usually in an avirulent form and
produces no epidemic of meningitis. Only an occasional case arises.
There are certain localities in which the disease is particularly prevalent
at all times. We may speak of these as endemic foci, but must remember
that at the same time the virus is distributed elsewhere. Thus
South Carolina, Missouri and Kansas have been shown to be localities
in which meningitis has been more or less widely distributed for some
years.</p>

<p class='c007'>We can carry the analogy still farther. During the concentration
of forces early in the war, camps were established at Columbia, S. C.
and at Fort Riley, Kansas. In these camps, Jackson and Funston,
there very rapidly developed quite extensive epidemics of cerebrospinal
meningitis. Here and in Camp Beauregard, the incidence of the
disease was out of all proportion to that in the other camps. Just
as the exaltation of virulence of the influenza virus has been favored by
gross changes in the environment, the occupation, the density of, and
the disease incidence in the host as a community, so also do these
appear to have been factors in the development of a meningitis prevalence
in the army. It was more prevalent in those camps situated in
the territories where the disease was particularly endemic, but was also
present in all camps. Had the meningococcus been able to assume
the high degree of virulence and invasiveness possessed by the influenza
virus it is reasonable to assume that a pandemic spread would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>begun in one of the two or three camps where the disease was especially
prevalent. It would have spread thence and have attacked those
camps in which a mildly virulent meningococcus had already been
causing disease. Just as in influenza the pandemic spread would
have been due not to the universally distributed virus, but to the one
or few which finally acquired the greatest exaltation of virulence.</p>

<p class='c007'>We see then that the followers of both theories—that of the single
focus and that of an extensive distribution—can quote other infectious
diseases in support of their theory, but the evidence in favor of similarity
to Asiatic cholera is not complete. The disease is not similar.
The mode of transmission is entirely different. The infection is chiefly
of the gastro-intestinal tract, while that in influenza is chiefly respiratory.
Since 1816 there have been five pandemics of Asiatic cholera,
the last occurring in 1883 and all of them traceable to a primary focus
in India. Frequently it was carried from India by the faithful, to
Mecca and from there was readily distributed throughout Europe.
In the last pandemic the disease spread throughout the old world and
reached New York harbor, but was refused admission.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Plague.</i>—The similarity in clinical symptomatology, in gross
pathology and the apparent similarity in manner of spread and epidemic
features between influenza and the pneumonic form of plague
has suggested to some that the best comparison should be made with
the latter disease. Here again is a disease which is endemic in Asia
and spreads elsewhere only at intervals. If we go back into the history
of the plague we will discover that formerly it was distributed more or
less throughout the civilized world. The plague is supposed to have
been known to the children of Israel at the time of the exodus from
Egypt. The Egypt of the Pharaohs was a country of great salubrity.
Hygienic measures were excellent. The inhabitants built aqueducts,
disposed of their dead hygienically, reared temples, maintained law
and order, developed the elements of literature and science and devised
and employed simple machinery. But as early as the exodus, Egypt
had lost its salubrity. This is indicated by many passages in the
Bible. The plague was present in that country during this period.
Sticker believes that the pest among the Philistines spoken of in the
First Book of Samuel, when the captured army was returned with five
golden emerods and five golden mice, was the bubonic plague.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thucydides describes a plague in Athens occurring before Christ.
This is generally believed to have been “the plague.” The time of the
earliest appearance of the disease in Italy is not known but it was well
established there in the first century of our era. The plague was endemic
in Italy at that time and it developed in epidemic form with each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>increase in susceptible material. At about 68 A.D. the disease spread
over the whole of Asia, Northern Africa and Europe. Exacerbations
of the disease are described in the years 80, 88 and 92 A.D. In Rome
they occurred in 102, 107 and 117 A.D. The disease was present in
Wales in 114 A.D. In 167 an unusually severe outbreak of the plague
occurred in Rome. There were other outbreaks in the Roman army
in 173, 175 and 178. Had we the space to record here the history of the
plague we would find that the disease was widely distributed throughout
Europe for several hundreds of years, that it was particularly
prevalent in certain areas and that at intervals it spread from one or a
few foci, throughout the continent.</p>

<p class='c007'>We can compare the epidemic features of influenza with these other
contagious diseases, but we will always find some points of difference
from one or another. Let us consider again for a moment epidemic
meningitis. There is no combination of predisposing causes, environmental,
meteorologic or bacteriologic which will produce epidemics of
cerebrospinal meningitis in the absence of the meningococcus itself.
The organism causing the disease must be present before the disease will
occur. The specificity of the invading organism in the different
diseases will always produce some variation among the epidemiologic
features. Other things being equal, that locality in which this germ
is most extensively distributed will be the locality in which epidemics,
when they do break out, will be most extensive.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of our army camps, those individuals carrying the
disease virus from the endemic foci to the camps were not the ones
who fell ill. Generally it was those, coming from other areas in which
meningitis was not extensively distributed and who had, therefore,
not acquired an increased resistance to the disease, who fell ill. But
after the disease had acquired increased virulence at Camp Jackson,
not only did it occur in the troops at that camp, but it also became
quite extensive throughout the civilian population, presumably
among those who had previously been exposed to it in its endemic form.</p>

<p class='c007'>In our comparison of influenza with other infectious diseases we
wish to show particularly that the disease is not in a class by itself,
but that its epidemiologic features are not unlike those of other respiratory
infections, that the manner of spread and the mode of infection
are similar to those of the other diseases. Nothing unusual or
unknown need be called into use in explaining any differences. Those
differences that very palpably exist can be explained by facts which
we already know. Leichtenstern, thirty years ago, believed that the
disease was similar in its manner of spread to other infectious diseases.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>He observed this particularly in the earliest and the latest phases of
epidemic spreads where cases were scattered. He saw that in households
the disease attacked some and spared others even of those intimately
connected with the sick, just as was the case in diphtheria or
meningitis. He writes: “Comparing these later periods the disease
evidences the same contagious characteristics as the other endemic
contagious diseases, such as scarlet fever, measles, diphtheria, epidemic
cerebrospinal meningitis, etc.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Parkes made very similar observations even before the 1889
epidemic.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Measles.</i>—A comparison of influenza and measles will offer some
explanation of the differences between the epidemic constitution of
the former and that of the other respiratory diseases.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are accustomed to think of measles as a disease which, like
meningitis, is disseminated throughout the civilized world, and which
although constantly with us causes only sporadic cases. True epidemics
of measles do occur, even when there is no gross change in the
constitution of the population. We have discussed examples of this
particularly in London. Flare-ups of measles prevalence are in fact
so much the rule that in certain localities health officers anticipate a
measles epidemic about once in two years. Furthermore measles has
been known more than once to occur in extensive epidemic form,
attacking large proportions of the population invaded. We know that
there is an immunity to measles which is nearly absolute in those who
have once acquired the disease. The epidemics have, therefore,
occurred exclusively in those localities where the proportion of immune
individuals was relatively small. According to Noah Webster in 1772
measles appeared in all parts of America and was accompanied by an
unusually high mortality. In Charleston 800 or 900 children died of
the disease. The following year measles “finished its course and was
followed by a disorder of the throat.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1781 measles disappeared from the Faroe Islands, and for the
following sixty-five years there was not a case of this disease anywhere
on any of the seventeen islands constituting the inhabited parts of
this group. When the disease was finally re-introduced into these
islands, it spread throughout the population, attacking practically
every individual in a relatively short interval of time, showing a much
higher attack rate than did influenza in 1918. There was this difference,
that the only individuals who did not acquire measles on its
re-introduction into the islands were those who had had it sixty-five
years before. Panum did not find an authentic case of recurrence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>in the same individual. There was not a single instance of second
attack of measles, although the shortest possible interval between the
previous attack and the subsequent exposure was sixty-five years.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1875 measles first reached the inhabitants of the Fiji Islands.
The disease was introduced by the King of the Fiji Islanders and his
escort, upon their return from New South Wales. The entire population
of the islands was estimated at 150,000 and it is officially stated
that there were 40,000 deaths from measles in the ensuing period. In
certain islands and villages where more exact information was secured,
it was found that from twenty-seven to twenty-eight per cent. of the
people died. Panic, insanitary conditions and ignorance of how to
care for the sick resulted in this high mortality. V. C. Vaughan has
remarked that when measles is introduced into a population with a
susceptibility of 100 per cent. “it strikes down so many at practically
the same time that adequate care for the sick is impossible.” The
rapidity with which the population is invaded is practically as great as
it is during influenza epidemics.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is the opinion of the author that the phenomenon which contributes
chiefly to the occurrence of influenza in epidemics and pandemics,
and which causes the characteristic curves of a primary influenza wave,
is the absence of any permanent immunity. We have shown in our
discussion that no immunity is proven to exist after a year and a half
or two years at the most. Measles occurring in a non-immune population
spreads through that population with the same high rate as does
the influenza. In Charts XXVIII and XXIX we find the curves of
incidence of measles in certain of the United States Army camps
in the fall and winter of 1917–18. The simplest curve is that for Camp
Wheeler. Here the type is similar to that found in the primary wave
of influenza. There is a quasi-symmetrical evolution and the concentration
is closely grouped around the maximum. The total duration
of the epidemic is short, not being much over eight weeks. The troops
at this camp were predominantly rural. The disease starting in this
group of relatively non-immunes spread rapidly until presumably all
susceptible material was exhausted. Compare Camp Wheeler with
those camps where the population was chiefly urban. Here the wave
is of longer duration, is not as high, the increase is slower, the decrease
is more gradual and the concentration is not grouped so closely about
the maximum. In the case of the other camps with chiefly rural
population, the curve is not as simple as is the case with Camp Wheeler,
and there are at times secondary curves as in the case of Camp Bowie,
but the essential similarity to the curve at Camp Wheeler and the difference
from the curves at Devens, Dix, Custer and Grant is striking.
It may be that the double waves are explained by acquisition of new
bodies of troops, by the introduction of new susceptible material. On
this question we have no exact information.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>This experience was equally true during the Civil war. Although
there are no exact reports, it appears that measles prevailed in the
Confederate army and was much more highly fatal than in the Union
army.</p>

<p class='c007'>A recurrent influenza epidemic usually takes the form of a secondary
wave, particularly so if it follows the primary wave within a short
period of time. The difference in the character of the wave is due to
the fact that there is still a comparatively large concentration of
immune individuals, immunized by having had the disease during the
primary spread. The secondary type of the influenza wave corresponds
with the measles curves for the urban camps. There are all
gradations in influenza from the typical primary wave down to a very
much flattened wave of relatively long duration, and even on to the
stage of endemicity, with no discernible wave. In 1920 the recurrent
epidemic partook more of the form of a primary wave, because in most
individuals the period of immunity had been completed by January
and February, 1920.</p>

<p class='c007'>If we could, by some means, induce an immunity which would last
for long periods of time, pandemic influenza would disappear from the
earth and the disease would be relegated to the comparatively minor
position now occupied by measles. The disease would be constantly
endemic, frequently breaking out in small epidemics, but never becoming
pandemic. This is one object that should be held in view by the
immunologists and bacteriologists. But it is not so simple. Even
were a successful vaccine discovered, it is doubtful whether any considerable
group of the population could be persuaded to take it as
often as would be necessary. Universal vaccination against small pox
has never been carried out. The same would be true at the present
time with regard to influenza.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is another similarity between measles and influenza.
Measles is as infectious as is influenza. It is as readily transmitted
and the mode of transmission is probably the same or very similar. In
both diseases we are made poignantly aware of the great contagiousness
of the disease, and yet in neither disease has there ever been conclusive
evidence of experimental transmission from man to man. Several
have reported attempts to transfer measles, but in each case the
evidence of infection has been incomplete. The work of Hektoen has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>been quoted in particular, but Sellards, after carefully reviewing his
work, concludes that the evidence of infection is insufficient. Moreover
Hektoen’s patients were not exposed subsequently to measles
infection in the natural way.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>SECTION VIII.</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c012'><span class='sc'>The Prevention and Control of Influenza.</span></h3>

<p class='c013'>Dr. Hamer has visualized the present state of our knowledge of epidemic
influenza in a manner which can scarcely be improved upon.
We, therefore, quote him at length: “It seems to me that, during the
last thirty years or more, we have been making fairly steady uphill
progress along the road which constitutes the boundary between the
county of epidemiology and the county of bacteriology, and that we
have at length reached, at a height considerably above sea level, the
foot of the mountain, on the very top of which lies hidden the secret of
an ‘epidemic constitution,’ and now we are face to face with a parting of
ways. Straight ahead is the frowning height, its summit in cloud.
On the right hand stretches away a fine road skirting the base of the
mountain. Along this road we have recently seen Dr. Brownlee
whirled away in his new car ‘periodogram.’ We are all hoping to hear
more from him, but as he is still insisting upon the primary, if not the
exclusive, importance of continuous variation in the virulence of the
germ, we have to realize that for the time Dr. Brownlee’s road is
going down-hill. On the other hand, on the left, there swerves away,
through the territory of the old epidemiology, another fine road,
which has been explored more particularly by believers in ‘skiey influences.’
So far as it has been traced this road is as flat as flat can be,
but of course there is always the possibility that after a while it will
begin to rise, as it skirts round the mountain, and leads to a good
vantage point from which to start climbing. At the risk, however,
of being laughed at, I venture to bring under notice the very rough
and at first sight unpromising ground directly in front of us. Along
this can be seen two obscurely marked sheep tracks proceeding at any
rate onwards and upwards. One diverges slightly towards the left
hand and it has been followed at various times by De Schweinitz and
others, naturalists bent on collecting ‘ultravisible viruses;’ the second
track, directed rather more to the right, has been explored by Reiner,
Müller, Massini, Penfold, and others, workers at the problem of discontinuous
variation by ‘mutation.’ As a matter of fact I have reason
to believe that two travellers, each of whom follows one of these tracks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>will keep in sight of and after a while will find that they are approaching
one another, and will ultimately meet at a small and retired upland
farm; then after passing some dogs and following the track until clear
of all stone walls, they will come right out in open ground on the face
of the mountain and can start straight up the steep. But it must here
be pointed out that there remains to be considered a fourth method of
approach to the mountain, the most direct of all; but that is by aeroplane
and is of course only open to those trained in metaphysics and
statistical methods. Investigators thus equipped are able to rise in
the air, to survey with careful scrutiny the whole of the ground beneath
them and to make the best use of details of information obtained by
scouting parties below. It is to be hoped that at no very distant date
a survey of the top of the mountain will thus become an accomplished
fact. Meantime, those who cannot fly may find useful employment in
examining the track beyond the farm. There is the chance there
of picking up facts relating to such questions as the ‘parasites associated
with a parasite,’ symbiosis, and the like; take, for example, a suggestion
made fourteen or fifteen years ago that the influenza organism
may at one time live in association with Pfeiffer’s bacillus, at another
with the Micrococcus catarrhalis, and so on; or the throat distemper
organism may be yoked now with the diphtheria bacillus and now with
the Streptococcus conglomeratus. (Is that, I wonder, now to be
regarded as a concept or as an occurrence or happening?)”</p>

<p class='c007'>At best our knowledge of the cause and manner of spread of influenza
is fragmentary and insufficient. Attempts to outline a system of
control and prevention based upon present concepts are met with
many discouragements. The next pandemic will not be prevented.
The disease will surely return. If the interval be sufficiently long it
may find us quite as unprepared as we were in 1918. Discouraging as
the outlook is there are many bright points upon which we must base
our hopes for future results.</p>

<p class='c007'>The difficulties are many: First the <i>diagnosis</i> of influenza is difficult
either in the individual case or in the form of a mild epidemic.
Even in 1918 the identification was often not definitely made until
after weeks had elapsed. Second, we know little concerning the
<i>mode of transmission</i> of the disease. We speak of “respiratory infection.”
We believe that the transmission is by a mechanism similar to
that for measles, but we have never experimentally transmitted either
disease. The <i>short incubation period</i> places us at a great disadvantage.
Were the interval between the occurrence of the first case and the
development of additional cases as long as it is in measles, the problem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>of isolation and quarantine would be simplified. As in measles the
disease is probably <i>very early infectious</i>, presumably before acute
symptoms develop. The majority of cases of influenza are <i>ambulatory</i>.
Many individuals do not take to their beds, but continue about their
work, spreading the disease wherever they go.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again, we are ignorant of the <i>period of infectiousness</i>. Dr. Meredith
Davies has made observations indicating that a patient becomes
non-infectious within one week after the temperature has become
normal. How many influenza patients remain isolated throughout
this period?</p>

<p class='c007'>A <i>carrier state</i> probably exists and plays a most significant part in
the spread.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet another drawback is the <i>apparent wide susceptibility</i> to the disease.
Were individuals definitely immunized by one attack the proportion
of susceptibles would be lessened, their concentration in a
population would be decreased, and the probability of their being
exposed would be proportionately diminished.</p>

<p class='c007'>An additional difficulty is that after an epidemic has once become
prevalent, we must combat not only the virus causing the disease but
also the <i>secondary invaders</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Epidemiologic work has shown that <i>crowd gatherings</i> are instrumental
in the spread of influenza. The density of population has not
been as definitely proven to be a factor. Crowding, however, does
play a part. Close crowding in communities must facilitate the
spread, but pandemics of influenza were known before the great
metropoleis existed. <i>Hygienic conditions</i> play their part in the
etiology. Finally, in the presence of every serious epidemic we must
also combat the <i>tendency to panic</i> in the population.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Anticipatory or preventive measures.</i>—It is erroneous today to
speak of measures for the prevention of influenza in a community.
We cannot prevent the disease. At most, we can anticipate the occurrence
of an epidemic and take precautionary measures by which the
spread and the severity of the disease may be minimized.</p>

<p class='c007'>First and foremost comes <i>education</i>. Education of the public, of
the medical profession and of health authorities. “Scare headlines”
in the newspapers during epidemics should be discouraged. Health
cartoons are of value, but when they express only partial truths they
cannot but do some harm. General education in hygienic methods and
in a knowledge of the spread of contagious diseases has already been
most productive. Many methods by which the public intelligence
could be reached are as yet untried. A daily paper in Boston devotes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>two columns a week to a discussion of public health problems, under
the title of “The Clinic.” The statements appearing in these columns
are nearly always the truth and are not exaggerations. There are
discussions of recent scientific work of interest to the reading public.
As has been emphasized by Carnwath, a page devoted to methods of
maintaining the health of the community would probably be of more
immediate value than are the many pages devoted to financial statements,
“such as the price of Mexican Eagles or of Peruvian Corporation
Preference.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>organization of health services</i> to combat unexpected epidemics
would be of great assistance. In times of peace, prepare for war. In
all but the largest cities the health authorities are generally so free
from contact with epidemics and are so pressed with routine that they
do not organize in readiness for an epidemic which may not come.
There should be a closer co-operative organization between health
officials and practising physicians, so that the latter may aid to a
greater extent in the public health work. The physician co-operates in
furnishing information required by the health officer, but too frequently
takes little interest in what further is done with this information. The
medical profession should be made to understand the importance of
public health work, should have a general comprehension of the
methods used in its execution and should particularly develop a
sympathetic and co-operative mental attitude.</p>

<p class='c007'>The medical societies of the country should be so organized that at
a moment’s notice their membership can be mobilized for the defense
of the community. There is much that the practising physician does
not know about influenza. One of the leading internists in one of our
largest cities, during the 1920 epidemic, refused to call his cases influenza
and treated them as mild “grip.” It is stated that he lost an
unusually large number of his patients. There are still many who
believe that the two diseases are not identical. Not only is this
detrimental to the patient, but as it results in failure to isolate the sick,
it is detrimental to the community.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nursing groups should be organized to aid at a moment’s notice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Much work has been done and great experience gained by both the
physicians and the nursing organizations during the last epidemic.
Now is the time to prepare for the next epidemic or pandemic. With
the remembrance of 1918 fresh in our minds we can establish a working
system, while if we delay until the expected arrival of another
epidemic much of our painfully acquired knowledge will have been
forgotten.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>Opinion differs as to whether influenza should be made a <i>reportable
disease</i>. The added expense would be not insignificant. This particular
malady presents the additional complication of being difficult
of diagnosis. The records would at best be inaccurate. The author
believes that certain experiments in reporting the disease even in
interepidemic times should be carried out. This should be done by
competent epidemiologists who could later formulate plans for the
permanent reporting of the disease. We will discuss this further under
the heading, “Constructive Research.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The use of <i>vaccines</i> has been tried. In 1918 it was almost universally
begun too late—after the epidemic had become prevalent.
Prophylactic vaccination should be inaugurated before the disease
actually becomes epidemic. Vaccination, particularly against the
secondary invaders, is entirely rational. It may not prevent influenza,
but it may protect against the serious complications in individuals
and may prevent to an extent the spread of secondary invaders in
the community.</p>

<p class='c007'>Greenwood aptly remarks that, “In estimating the total effects
produced upon morbidity and mortality by disease, the non-specific
secondary invaders are as important as the specific causes. The camp
followers of an army may do more damage than the regular soldiers,
and the same camp followers may ravage in the wake of different
armies.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At a conference held at the London War Office, October 14, 1918,
the subject of vaccination for influenza was discussed. It was decided
that only three organisms should be employed in each case in the
preparation of the vaccine; that these races should be recently isolated
from cases of the disease developing during the course of the epidemic
and that the microorganisms should be submitted to a rigorous study
as to race and type. The first dose should include 30,000,000 of
Bacillus influenzae, 100,000,000 pneumococcus, 40,000,000 streptococcus;
the second dose 60,000,000 Bacillus influenzae, 200,000,000
pneumonococcus, 50,000,000 streptococcus. The vaccine should be
sterilized at 55° C. and one-half per cent. phenol should be added.
The administration should be at ten days’ intervals.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the United States the vaccines employed have often contained a
greater variety of organisms. It is unnecessary to enumerate the
results obtained by various investigators. Some have been mildly
enthusiastic, while others have obtained no demonstrable benefit.
It will suffice to say that there has been no clear evidence that vaccination
has been beneficial, but that the procedure has not been given a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>thorough trial. If the causative organism of the disease is eventually
determined, vaccination will probably be attempted with it as antigen.
For the success of vaccination it is important that practically entire
communities be inoculated, and that they be so inoculated before the
development of epidemic prevalence.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Palliative measures in the presence of an epidemic.</i>—An epidemic,
once having obtained a start will run its course. Our attempts will
be to lessen its extent and diminish its explosiveness. Or, more probably,
we will best succeed by <i>extending</i> the duration and making the invasion
less explosive. We must know of its earliest appearance. <i>Notification</i>
must be made by physicians to the health authorities in order that
the earliest increase may be detected. This again renders the reporting
of the disease at all times an essential feature. The <i>administrative
control</i> and the <i>publicity</i> to be given have already been discussed.</p>

<p class='c007'>What general measures should be taken against the disease?
Should the <i>public schools</i> be closed? Winslow and Rogers found that
the orthodox methods of combating epidemics applied in Connecticut
exerted no appreciable influence on the spread of influenza. Bridgeport,
Hartford and New Haven <i>did not close</i> their schools and suffered
from death rates near the average for the State, lower than the rates
which prevailed in cities like New London and Waterbury, which
closed their schools. No deductions can be drawn from this fact,
however, because the closing of the schools in most cases was forced
because of the severity of the outbreak.</p>

<p class='c007'>The data obtained by Jordan indicate that schools were not
important distributing centers for the infection. No explosive outbreak
occurred in any one grade, and the four days of the Thanksgiving
holiday evidently afforded more favorable opportunities for
infection than did the days of regular school attendance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Carnwath believes that in view mainly of the marked prevalence
of the disease amongst school children, the balance of opinion is in
favor of closure, even in densely populated urban districts. In the
author’s investigation there was a slightly higher incidence of the
disease among children attending school than among those younger
children who were not at school. The spread is probably not facilitated
so much in the class room as it is on the play ground. In the
school room the children are constrained to remain at a certain distance
from each other. Probably they would come into as close contact
with cases if they were not at school. Certainly it has not been
demonstrated that the school room is a factor of great importance in
the spread of influenza. It would, perhaps, be better not to close the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>schools in the presence of an epidemic, but to discontinue any congregation
on the play grounds, and to discourage the grouping of children
in play on the streets.</p>

<p class='c007'>With children and with all individuals, large or small, a great
factor in exposure and probably in the transmission of the disease is
the necessary <i>crowding on street cars and in public buildings</i>. Here is a
potent source which requires deep study and new treatment. Some
cities have with partial success attempted lessening the congestion
in public conveyances at the beginning and closing of business hours
by arranging with the various offices, stores, etc., that the opening and
closing times occur at different hours. In order that this procedure
may work it is important that the employees of a factory or store which
closes early must ride to their destination at the time of closing and
not remain in the congested business districts. Here again it is a
problem of educating the public to a point where they will co-operate
intelligently.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been amply demonstrated that <i>crowd gatherings</i> markedly
facilitate the spread of the disease. Mass meetings should be prohibited
and gatherings in and out of doors should be discouraged.
The public should be taught that the safest place is at home.</p>

<p class='c007'>What <i>instructions</i> can we give <i>to the individual</i> for his own protection?
There are at least six precautions based on scientific knowledge.
They are:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>First:</dt>
    <dd>Avoid crowds.
    </dd>
    <dt>Second:</dt>
    <dd>Avoid crowding in the family.
    </dd>
    <dt>Third:</dt>
    <dd>Sleep alone.
    </dd>
    <dt>Fourth:</dt>
    <dd>Pay particular attention to personal hygiene.
    </dd>
    <dt>Fifth:</dt>
    <dd>Boil all dishes, etc., after meals.
    </dd>
    <dt>Sixth:</dt>
    <dd>Do not eat in insanitary restaurants. Eat at home.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c007'>Should cases be <i>isolated</i>? Should they be quarantined until no
longer infective? The experience of the last epidemic has rendered us
pessimistic. We have found that isolation and quarantine does little
or no good. Institutions which were held under rigid quarantine for
the first months of the epidemic were later invaded when discipline
became lax. The disease thereafter spread often as extensively as it
would have, had there been no delay. But, on the other hand, there
is record of some institutions in which the quarantine lasted throughout
the epidemic and in which the inmates never became ill. All of our
past experience with infectious diseases leads us to believe that isolation
of cases should be enforced. The experience of 1918 should not
cause us to change from this point of view. Up until now the procedure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>has been without results. It has been nearly impossible to
enforce it. Further study must be made before any definite conclusion
can be reached.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same in general may be said regarding <i>disinfection</i> after recovery
of a case of influenza. Today most people believe that disinfection
is unnecessary. The work of Lynch and Cumming, if correct,
would indicate the contrary. The possibility of transmission through
inanimate objects has not as yet been completely eliminated.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>efficacy of face masks</i> is still open to question. Certainly the
face mask as extensively used during the 1918 epidemic was of little
benefit and in many cases was, without doubt, a decided detriment.
The same mask was worn until it was filthy. It was not worn in such
a way as to be a protection. Even had the nose and mouth been
efficiently protected, the conjunctivae remained unprotected. The
work of Maxcy and of Vincent and others has demonstrated the
importance of the naso-lachrymal duct as a possible portal of entry
into the respiratory tract proper. After cultures of Bacillus prodigiosus
were sprayed upon the ocular conjunctivae these organisms have
been recovered from the nose within five minutes, from the nasopharynx
within fifteen minutes and from the feces within twenty-four
hours. One difficulty in the use of the face mask is the failure of co-operation
on the part of the public. When, in pneumonia and influenza
wards, it has been nearly impossible to force the orderlies or even
some of the physicians and nurses to wear their masks as prescribed,
it is difficult to see how a general measure of this nature could be
enforced in the community at large. If masks are to be used they
should be employed in the same manner as for protection against the
plague. They should be made to cover the entire head. This procedure
has been recommended particularly by Vincent and by Thorne.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is safe to say that the face mask as used was a failure.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Problems for the future.</i> <i>Constructive research.</i>—While pure epidemiologic
study of influenza will not demonstrate the causative
agent, it is the chief procedure upon which we can at present rely for
improvement in our methods of combat. Many important laboratory
contributions have been made during the last two years. The majority
have been without immediate value to the health officer. The
author suggests in the following paragraphs a plan of study, based
upon past epidemics and the experiences of the last pandemic, as
epitomized in the preceding chapters. During the exposition of this
subject we have drawn certain conclusions and have developed some
theories. We believe that they explain the facts correctly, but should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>the hypotheses prove not entirely correct the value of the following
outline for study will be in no way impaired.</p>

<p class='c007'>To become thoroughly acquainted with epidemic influenza in all its
manifestations would require a life time of study. Knowledge of the
disease would be greatly furthered if competent epidemiologists should
see fit to devote their entire time to a study of the disease in its various
ramifications. The author suggests a research organization of individuals
whose function it would be to become completely acquainted
with influenza. The organization should be under the direction of a
competent board of epidemiologists. Under them would work several
groups composed of epidemiologists, bacteriologists and others.
There should be sufficient groups so that they might be distributed to
diverse regions of the earth. They should be equipped for travel,
with mobile bacteriologic laboratories and all the necessary equipment
for epidemiologic surveys, so that at a moment’s notice they could
proceed to wherever an epidemic of any disease simulating influenza
is reported to be prevalent. The working groups would be under the
administrative control of the central directors and would make their
reports to them. All groups should be so distributed geographically
as to have easy and rapid access to any community in which an epidemic
might occur. They would keep themselves informed concerning
the disease prevalence in all communities under their jurisdiction.
This would be done through the co-operation of the civil health
authorities and through the utilization of all other available sources of
information. The central board should be constantly in touch with
the groups, so that the infectious disease prevalence in all parts of
the world would be known at all times.</p>

<p class='c007'>Had such an organization been in existence during the last thirty
years, every one of the so-called influenza epidemics reported in one
place or another would have been investigated. Detailed epidemiologic,
statistical, demographic and bacteriologic reports would have
been made. It matters little how small or insignificant the outbreak
appears to be. Even the smallest have their characteristic features
and are worthy of study. If we study epidemic influenza but once
in thirty years, we will never become well acquainted with the disease.
We must see it repeatedly and frequently. If it does not exist during
the intervals we must study the diseases simulating it. It is surprising
how much of the knowledge acquired in 1889 was forgotten by 1918.
Even some of the more important features had passed from memory.
Thus we find statements in 1918 that the age morbidity was quite
different from that in all preceding epidemics. Research into the
literature of the past does not corroborate this impression.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>If influenza is scattered throughout the earth in mild form, it
would avail us but little to send a commission to Bokhara to study the
endemic focus supposed by some to exist in Turkestan. Even though
the disease were endemic in that country, one would not expect to
discover epidemics there. The general immunity of the population
in the endemic area is probably increased. Nevertheless one unit
might well be stationed in Turkestan, there to study the existing
conditions regarding infectious diseases.</p>

<p class='c007'>There would be ample work for all groups at all times. The study
would not be limited to a consideration of infectious diseases. Sociologic
conditions may be of importance. We have recorded instances
of this. Wherever there is an unusual concentration of large masses
of individuals the investigators should study the results of such
concentration.</p>

<p class='c007'>An advantage of this organization would be that the groups through
their central bureau would establish an information bureau of infectious
disease prevalence analogous to the popular weather bureau of
today. They would report the presence of a cloud before it had
appeared on the local horizon.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the absence of any epidemics resembling influenza, there would
be abundant opportunity for correlated work. We have mentioned
the epidemiologic resemblances between influenza and certain other
infectious diseases. Comparative study of any or all of them is of
importance. The bacteriologist and the immunologist would find
plenty of material in the study of measles prevalences. The two
diseases are so similar in their manner of spread, in the probable mode
of transmission, in their clinical characteristics and in the results of
laboratory attempts at transmission, that one must assume that the
causative viruses are not dissimilar. Any new facts that we may gain
concerning measles will be of value in the study of influenza.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many years could be well devoted merely to a study of immunity
in influenza.</p>

<p class='c007'>The results obtained by this proposed organization for the investigation
of influenza would be slow in achievement. The study is not
of a type calculated to appeal to the popular imagination. Communities
in which the dread of an imminent pestilence is not present
would subscribe with some hesitation to appeals for pecuniary assistance.
Fortunately, however, there are in existence several organizations
already well developed along these lines, organizations chiefly
interested in certain other diseases. There can be no doubt but that
at the present time the financing of such a broad project could be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>arranged, and that the groups could be efficiently organized on the
basis of experience already gained in similar projects.</p>

<p class='c007'>Crookshank well remarks that our present epidemiologic intelligence
service is hardly superior to that of a Meteorologic Office which
only gives warning of rain when unfurled umbrellas pass along the
street. Influenza will surely return. There will be mild epidemics
within the next few years. In time another pandemic will arrive, and
after it will come pandemic after pandemic. In 1918 as in 1889 we
were caught unprepared. Let us do our utmost to prevent the
recurrence of this tragedy. To delay is to loose the valuable information
gained during the last two years. The future is not without well
grounded hope, but success will not be achieved until we have attained
a much deeper understanding of the epidemiology of influenza.</p>
